The Flemish Government's decision to amend the Flemish Government's decision of 13 November 2020 to regulate a general and selective subsidy for the organisers of childcare and out-of-school care and measures for the families in childcare and out-of-school care following the consequences of the COVID-19 virus, as regards the extension, and the scheme of compensation in the absence of vaccination Legal grounds This decision is based on: - the Decree of 30 April 2004 establishing the self-employed agency with legal personality Growing up, Article 5, § 2, 2°, a), inserted by the Decree of 1 March 2019, and Article 12, amended by the Decrees of 1 March 2019 and 3 May 2019; - the Decree of 20 April 2012 concerning the organisation of childcare of babies and toddlers, Article 10, 3°, and Article 12, paragraph 2, and § 3, inserted by the Decree of 15 July 2016. Shape requirements are fulfilled: - The Flemish Minister, responsible for the budget, has given his agreement on 19 March 2021. - There is no advice requested to the Council of State with the application of Article 1, Article 1, 3 of the Council of January, 3nd, 3rd, and Article 12th, paragraph, and § 3, of the second paragraph 3, by the Decree of 15 July 2016.It is a very precarious period in which the epidemic can still go all the way. With these matters in mind, it is necessary for the Flemish government to align its policy with the federal measures aimed at limiting social contacts and not to encourage people to engage unnecessarily. More importantly, it is necessary for the Flemish government to guarantee the financial viability of the childcare sector and the sector of extra-school care and ensure that this takes place beyond March 2021. Since the current regulation provides for the compensation scheme to apply until the end of March 2021, it is urgently necessary to adopt this decision, so that it is clear to the Flemish Government of 13 November 2020 that it will be able to count on a grant for the period up to June 2021 as long as it would be necessary. Even an opinion on five days of the Council of State is not possible, since in order to implement the aforementioned decision of the Flemish Government of 13 November 2020 will have to be taken by the Minister before the end of March 2021 in which he determines whether the general, then selective compensation.
