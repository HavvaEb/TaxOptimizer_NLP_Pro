The Royal Decree amending the Royal Decree of 15 September 2020 granting, pursuant to the COOVID-19 pandemic, an additional crisis benefit to certain disabled self-employed persons and assisting spouses REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, The Royal Decree which we have the honour to submit for signature, aims to extend until 30 September 2021 the granting of an additional crisis benefit to certain disabled self-employed persons and assisting spouses as a result of the COOVID-19 pandemic. In the light of the Council of State's Opinion No 69.546/1 of 15 June 2021 and in the light of the comments made, the supplementary crisis benefit referred to in the Royal Decree of 15 September 2020 granting, pursuant to the COVID-19 pandemic, an additional crisis benefit to certain disabled self-employed persons and assisting spouses is no longer granted for the period of incapacity beyond 30 June 2021.This measure, which is expressly linked to the COOVID-19 pandemic, is therefore compatible, within the benefit insurance scheme, with the constitutional principle of equality in view of the scale, severity and exceptional nature of this COOVID-19 pandemic which enables numerous self-employed and assisting spouses to no longer pursue their professional activity and to claim only benefits from this benefit insurance.
