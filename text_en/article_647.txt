The main additions relate to: - A temporal extension to the second Semester 2020 of certain reliefs (meetings relating to the declining regular activity and the additional activities of health care providers are also provided for a deadline for the increased cost and availability of funds, namely 30 September 2021;The purpose of this financing is to allocate an amount in proportion to the commitment shown. Article 2 describes the staff costs covered by the concession under the UFFT. Article 3 contains some technical adjustments and sets an end date for the flat-rate allowances on 30 September 2021. Article 4 contains technical corrections and an extension of the allowances: - a flat-rate allowance is provided for the missed income of hospitals from invoicings borne by the patient on the basis of the tariff regulation of the sickness insurance scheme. These are part of the reimbursement for the operating costs of the hospitals; - an intervention is provided to cover the missed revenue for care to patients who are not affiliated to an insurance institution; - the allowances provided for are extended to the second semester 2020.

Article 10 of the Decision amends Article 8 of the KB UFFT in order to clarify that another use is possible, in so far as it complies with the requirements laid down in the Decision and on condition that the ASO and HAIO have obtained their contractually legitimate fees. This clarification is intended to make it more clear that any ASO and HAIO operating in the hospital are subject to a gross premium of EUR 250 per month.Article 7 of the Decision lays down that, in order to ensure that the conditions laid down in point (a) of Article 7 of the Act of Accession are met, the conditions laid down in Article 7 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Convention of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Convention of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Convention of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Convention of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Convention of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Convention of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Convention of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Convention of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Convention of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Convention of Accession of Spain to the Convention of Accession of Spain to the Convention of the European Union to the Convention of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Convention of the European Union and to the Convention of the European Union of the Kingdom of Spain and to the Convention of Accession of Spain and to the Convention of Spain to the Convention of the European Union and to the Convention of the European Union of the Kingdom of Spain and to the European Union of Spain and to the Convention of Spain and to the Convention of Spain and to the Convention of the United States of Spain to the Convention of Spain.On the basis of Article 11 of the amending decision, it is clarified that the calculation of the allowances for the ASO and HAIO is also made available by the hospital. - The granting possibilities to the individual health care providers are more clearly defined. - An explicit possibility for a revision of the allowances for the ASO and HAIO on the basis of the actual payout for the ASO and HAIO on the basis of the actual payment of the change decision applies as follows:VVVL and the Service of Medical Evaluation and Control of the RIZIV shall continue to apply by means of the Sickness Insurance Scheme, to be recovered in accordance with the procedure laid down in the law on compulsory medical care and benefits.
