Article 5 of the draft decision provides, for the period up to 31 December 2020, for a written procedure for communicating the defences to the unemployment office by the worker to whom a decision to exclude entitlement to benefits may be imposed. This procedure temporarily replaces the existing procedure of summoning the employee to a personal interview, which now optionally includes the possibility of a written defence. The provision of this derogation scheme until 31 December 2020 is justified and proportionate because the forced closure of the offices of the RVA has led to a delay in the treatment of the interviews during the last three months.In order to exempt the temporarily unemployed from the use of a control card for the month of February 2020, the ratio legis is missing, since this month had already expired, the check cards had already been submitted to the paying institutions and the payment of the benefits on the basis of them had already been made. Moreover, such measure would not be consistent with Articles 11 and 13 of the Royal Decree of 30 March 2020, which exempt the employer from issuing a check card to the employee from 1 March 2020 and its registration in a validation book. Furthermore, this correction does not affect the temporarily unemployed person's rights since he had already been obliged to behave in accordance with the rules for the period of February 2020 to be verified at the time of payment of the benefits.COVID-19 virus and amending Article 10 of the Royal Decree of 6 May 2019 amending Articles 27, 51, 52a, 58, 58/3 and 63 of the Royal Decree of 25 November 1991 on unemployment regulation and incorporating Articles 36sexies, 63a and 124a into the same act.'
