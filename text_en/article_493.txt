Decision of the Walloon Government of special powers No 51 on the phasing-out measures COVID-19 on employment and socio-professional involvement, social economy included REPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT The extraordinary health crisis in relation to COVID-19 affecting Belgium and the current and upcoming rules adopted to limit the spread of the virus to the population are such that they delay any activity in the territory of the Walloon Region. In addition to the impact on health, this health crisis also - and still - has an important economic and social impact in Wallonia, which affects in particular our most vulnerable citizens. Therefore, in this context of dismantling the lockdown, which is of essential importance to take measures to resume the activities aimed at restoring a positive, constructive and transversal dynamic in the field of employment and socio-professional integration, it should also be taken into account the dimension of equal opportunities of women, which are particularly represented in these sectors.Under Article 1 of the Decree of 17 March 2020 granting special powers to the Walloon Government in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis, the Government is empowered to take all appropriate measures to prevent and address any situation which constitutes a problem within the strict framework of the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences and which must be dealt with as a matter of urgency; the urgency of the measures taken is justified by the fact that, despite the improvement of the situation, strict compliance with health measures must be maintained; that, in order to delay and limit the spread of the virus, it is necessary to take immediately the recommended measures necessary from the point of view of public health to accompany the measures necessary; that the direct or indirect effects of the crisis require rapid management and rapid reaction at regional level; that the crisis may affect the sectors and systems of employment and in the social economy; that it is essential to accompany the resumption of activities with the objectives of these schemes; that the immediate and indirect effects of the crisis must be ensured by theFor the purpose of verifying compliance with the total volume of the suspension referred to in paragraph 1, the employer (local authorities) who, despite the suspension, could not have met their overall employment volume due to the effects of the health crisis in the medium term, may apply for a ministerial derogation. Such an option already exists for employers in the non-commercial sector. Article 3 suspends the time limits imposed on employers to employ a non-working job seeker after the granting of a new decision to grant the APE aid or in the event of the replacement of an employee who has left the company. This provision is intended to prevent the employer from losing the benefit of his decision when he is forced to postpone the initial recruitment due to the occurrence of the health crisis COVID-19. This suspension will take effect on 1 May 2020 in order to prevent employers whose decision expires from the suspension.The restructuring of the artistic sector in the course of time will have to be extended and the restrictions on the artistic sector at present do not have a clear timetable. Events with large numbers of people are still prohibited and will probably continue to be affected for a long time by the health crisis, causing artists and especially young people who are now or in the coming months integrating the sector to be severely disadvantaged. In Article 9, temporary unemployment is taken up as one of the reasons for the suspension of the grant of aid. This makes it possible to suspend the duration in which the worker/job seeker can benefit from the "Impulsion aid" scheme. The purpose of this measure is to prevent the calculation of the maximum duration of the grant from being taken into account with periods of temporary unemployment when the worker does not receive activation benefit. The effect of the measure is linked to the maintenance by the federal government of temporary unemployment opportunities COVID-19, which has been extended until 31 August 2020. The measure applies until 31 December to cover a possible extension of the temporary unemployment measures by the federal government.Article 13 lays down the method of calculating the amount of the allowance, taking into account the employment agreements of the employees, the number of service cheques issued during the month and the planned amount of the regional contribution on an hourly basis, on a degressive basis, for the months of June, July and August 2020. This measure is intended to protect employees and to facilitate the organisation of work within the undertaking with a view to the partial and gradual resumption of activities. Article 14 lays down the procedure to be followed to qualify for this contribution. Article 15 lays down what is meant by service cheque workers to cover, on the one hand, the health, medical and paramedical costs and the maintenance costs of the premises resulting from the health crisis and, on the other hand, the purchase of computer equipment to render services. This provision shall enter into force on 1 January 2020 when the expenditure in favour of the MIRE (Western consignments for employment) can be made in accordance with Article 1 of this Regulation.Article 20 shall be adapted to the rules governing the allocation of the allowance to the extension of the period referred to in Article 20. Section 6 - Initiatives for the development of employment in the sector of neighbourhood services with a social purpose (IDESS) Article 21 allows IDESS to extend its activities relating to the social transport of persons to that of goods when such transport of goods is intended to carry out the messages or transport of the laundry of the beneficiaries of the services of IDESS. This is intended to help the beneficiaries of IDESS and to prevent them from carrying out non-essential travels. Since the calculation is valid between 1 June and 31 December 2020, it shall have an effect on the year 2020.On 11 June 2020, the Board was composed of Martine Baguet, President of the Chamber, Luc Cambier and Bernard Blero, State Councils, and Anne-Catherine Van Geersdaele, Registrar. Report was published by Véronique Schmitz, Hearing Officer. The Opinion with the following text was delivered on 11 June 2020. According to Article 84 (1) (1) (3) of the Laws................................................................................................................................................................................................................... In accordance with Article 6 of the said Decree, entry into force on 18 March 2020 has taken place. If the proposed text has no legal basis (1). 2. In accordance with Article 3 (2) of the Decree of 17 March 2020, the draft decision will be notified to the Bureau of Parliament prior to its publication in the Belgian Official Journal. General remark According to the draft decision, the reference date for the derogations provided for in Article 1 of the Arrangement (Articles 10, 11 and 22), 30 June 2021 (Article 9) or 1 July 2021 (Article 12).The Decree of 17 March 2020 must therefore form the first paragraph of the introductory sentence of Article 1 of the Constitution. The first paragraph will be omitted because it refers to Article 39 of the Constitution. The provisions of Article 1 No provision is made that a decision taken by the Walloon Region in regional matters must contain the indication provided for in Article 1. This provision - which also wrongly refers to "this decree" - must therefore be omitted. Article 5 On the question of Article 5, the Member of the Minister stated that: "Article 5 of the draft decision providing for the possibility to derogate from the functions granted to the employer by way of derogation from Article 12 of the APE decision of 19 December 2002: Article 12 provides that the employer may request a temporary change of his decision on the granting of the APE aid in 2002."The first paragraph of Article 10 of the Decree of 2 February 2017 on aid for employment for the target groups. It is an additional reason to suspend the grant of the aid in addition to the aid provided for in this provision, and not for a derogation. Article 10 shall be revised accordingly. Article 12 The fourth paragraph provides that "FOREM, depending on the number of applications, shall distribute the financing equally between the agencies responsible for their expenditure within the period referred to in paragraph 3." The method of distribution shall be unclear as it is not specified whether the "equal" distribution of funding is proportionate to the amount of expenditure and/or to the number of agencies using the mechanism shall be clarified at this point.Article 20 of the same decree and which lays down the conditions for the intensity of the aid. 2. The second paragraph is drawn up in such a way that when calculating the intensity, the months "from March to August 2020" are not taken into account. The discussion of Article 20 should be reviewed in the sense that the months "June to September 2020" are indicated as a period. Article 22 From the discussion of Article 22 it follows that the social transport between 1 June 2020 and 31 December 2020 is the transport of goods for the benefit of the beneficiaries referred to in Article 1, paragraph 4°, of the Decree of 14 December 2006 "on the recognition and subsidisation of the "Initiatives de développement de l'emploi dans le secteur des services de proxiité à finalité sociale" (Initiatives on the development of the sector of local services with a social purpose) shall be reduced by:The report to the Government of 31 March 2020 of special powers No 11 on various provisions relating to employment, training and socio-professional involvement, including social economy, for the period from 1 March 2020 to 31 May 2020 (6), and which are repeated in the draft text from 1 June 2020.On 14 January 2016, No 3/2016, B.22; G.H., 3 February 2016, No 16/2016, B.12.1; G.H., 28 April 2016, No 58/2016, B.9.2; G.H., 9 February 2017, No 15/2017, B.9.2 5Footnote No 23 of the above-mentioned opinion: Standing case law of the Constitutional Court.
