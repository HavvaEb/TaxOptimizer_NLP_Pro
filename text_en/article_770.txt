Royal Decree amending the Royal Decree of 22 April 2020 laying down special measures for the staff of the Federal Public Service in the context of the health crisis resulting from the Coronavirus COVID-19 REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, The Royal Decree which I have the honour to submit to Your Majesty for signature is intended to provide a response to the difficulties arising from the urgent measures taken to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus COVID-19. The current measures taken in the context of the health crisis resulting from the Coronavirus COVID-19 are always of that order that they may affect the proper functioning of the federal services, and may even suspend certain services, and the rights and obligations of the official of the Federal Public Service in the exercise of his duties in the course of his duties.Article 7 (1) states that, if the above measures are not feasible, the lead official shall not grant a service exemption for the period or periods in which no duties have been assigned to the staff member. The special temporary measure to rely on service exemption shall be limited to 31 March 2021. The measure shall not provide the general temporary framework for that exemption; it shall not prejudice the determination of a period prior to that date in a decision of individual exemption granted by the leading official to a staff member. For the purpose of an adequate response, the general limit for the grant of the exemption laid down in Article 31 March 2021 shall not be deferred by the ministerial decision of the Minister in charge of the federal public office, in order to cope with the possible maintenance of the current health crisis after that date.The first paragraph of Article 6 (1) of the Decision of 22 April 2020 provides for the suspension or extension of the temporary posting of staff, subject to the agreement of the parties concerned. Finally, the Directorate-General for Recruitment and Development shall support the implementation of the temporary posting, in particular by meeting the actors involved in the process, by aligning the available resources to existing needs, etc. Finally, it shall be stated that the fact that Article 7 is applicable does not preclude the provision of a federal service within the meaning of Article 5. The fact that a staff member has a duty exemption does not prevent him from applying to organizations in the context of this health crisis does not preclude him from being placed at the disposal of a federal service or of his own motion.On 18 November 2020, the Council of State, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Civil Service, Public Enterprises, Telecommunications and Post, within a period of five working days, to give an opinion on a draft Royal Decree amending the Royal Decree of 22 April 2020 laying down special measures for staff of the Federal Public Service in the context of the health crisis caused by the Coronavirus COVID-19'. The draft was examined by the Fourth Chamber on 25 November 2020. The Chamber was composed of Martine Baguet, Chamber Chairman, Luc Cambier and Bernard Blero, State Councils, and Charles-Henri Van Hove, attached Registrar.In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, the first paragraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 is to be interpreted as meaning that the conditions laid down in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 are to be met.On 20 April 2020, the draft Dispossive Article 1 provides that the staff referred to in paragraph 1 who do not belong to the medical staff shall be made available to any public or private institution belonging to the health sector but also to that of the reception, housing or education which so requests shall be far too generous. Thus, it does not indicate the types of applications which can be submitted, the types of institutions which can make applications or the criteria under which all those applications will be examined. (2) The operative and report to the King must be supplemented in those various points. Article 2 of the draft Article 2 of the Law, which amends Article 8 of the Royal Decree of 22 April 2020, is worded as follows: "Article 8, first and second paragraphs of the same Decision shall be replaced by the words '31 December 2020'.2 of the draft, for the reference period applicable to the catching-up in the services concerned, a new deadline is set, namely "31 March 2021', which, moreover, may be extended by the Minister of Civil Service cases pursuant to Article 3 2° of the draft (draft Article 9, third paragraph, 2°, of the Royal Decree of 22 April 2020). The comment made in Opinion 67.245/4 must therefore be repeated: the author of the draft must, in the report to the King, show that the conditions for one of the exceptions or derogations referred to in Articles 17 to 22 of Directive 2003/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003, are fulfilled in the light of the authorisation granted by the proposed Article 9, third paragraph, of the draft, to the Minister to extend "the reference period referred to in Article 8 (1) of the first and second paragraph of Article 3 of Article 9 of Article 9 of Article 9, but must be stated as 31 March 2021.Having regard to the Act of 20 May 1997 laying down certain aspects of the organisation of working time in the public sector, Articles 5, § 4, second paragraph, 7, § 3, second paragraph, 8, § 2, second paragraph, and 13, § 4, second paragraph; having regard to the Royal Decree of 22 April 2020 laying down special measures for staff of the federal public office in the context of the health crisis caused by the Coronavirus COVID-19; having regard to the exemption from the regulatory impact analysis provided for in Article 8, § 1, 4°, of the Law of 15 December 2013 laying down various provisions on administrative simplification; having regard to the opinion of the State inspector, given on 5 November 2020; having regard to the agreement reached by the State Secretary for Budget, given on 9 November 2020; having regard to Protocol No 756 of 20 November 2020 of the Committee for the Federal, the Community and Regional Administrations; having regard to the high degree of justification by the proven correlation of the coronavirus and the principle of the State Secretary of State for Budget, given on 9 November 2020;For the purpose of applying Article 84, paragraph 1, paragraph 3 of the Laws of the Council of State, coordinated on 12 January 1973; to the nomination of the Minister of Civil Service and to the opinion of the Ministers meeting in Council, We have decided and decide: Article 1.
