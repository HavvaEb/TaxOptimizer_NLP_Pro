Decision of the Flemish Government to grant a grant to local authorities to strengthen the source search to combat the COVID-19 pandemic Legal grounds This decision is based on: - the special law of 8 August 1980 on the reform of the institutions, Article 20, as amended by the special law of 16 July 1993 and Article 87 (1); - the law of 16 May 2003 laying down the general provisions applicable to budgets, the control of grants and the accounts of the communities and regions, as well as the organisation of the audit by the Court of Auditors, Article 3 (3); - the Flemish Codex Public Finances of 29 March 2019, Article 71 to 77; - the decree of 18 December 2020 on the general budget of the Flemish Community for the financial year 2021, Article 12; - the decision of Flemish Codex Public Finance of 17 May 2019, Article 29 to 31 and Article 43. Shape requirements The following formal requirements are fulfilled: - The Finance Inspectorate has given its opinion on 30 June 2021. - The Flemish Minister has given his agreement for budget for the financial year 2021, Article 12; - The Flemish Codex Public Finance Committee for the processing of personal data on 17 May 2019, Article 29 to 31 and Article 43.A major management tool for the rapid identification and quarantine of (1) infected persons, (2) to detect and isolate clusters as well as (3) to continue to encourage and sensitise citizens in order to maintain the basic measures to break the transmission of the COOVID-19 virus and to reduce this pandemic. - The local authorities take the only level of concrete action to strengthen the source detection. They establish links by analysing the available data, including the data obtained from the cooperation agreement with the care council, which appears to reduce random contamination to one and the same source in order to limit the further spread of COOVID-19 by adjusting the local policy on infection control. When they detect hotspots, they also take measures to isolate them and, if possible, reduce them. - In the meantime, the vaccination campaign in Flanders is progressing with rassepasses. Nevertheless, in the coming months it will be necessary: it is a second important protection line against the spread of the virus.In addition, there is insufficient certainty about the duration of the protection offered by the current vaccines. Therefore, there is a risk that group immunity is not sufficiently high to pass through the autumn and winter period.. Any citizen who can be convinced to respect the basic measures, and any person accompanied by the retention of isolation or quarantine, is an additional brake on the spread of the virus. - The added value of the local initiatives is in the additional support of the central initiatives as well as in the quality increase of the information obtained. A preliminary evaluation of the period 1 November 2020 to 31 March 2021 shows the added value of the local authorities' decision. By their direct contact with the citizen and in-depth knowledge of the local situation, the local authorities can deal with the source detection and quarantine coaching very effectively. They take various actions and use various methodologies to quickly locate and collect new infections.The decision of the Flemish Government of 23 April 2021 to grant a grant to local authorities to strengthen the source detection (for the period from 1 April 2021 to 30 June 2021) and the contact research (for the period from 1 April 2021 to 31 May 2021) to combat the COVID-19 pandemic; - The decision of the Flemish Government of 7 May 2021 to amend the decision of the Flemish Government of 23 April 2021 to grant a grant to local authorities to strengthen the source detection (for the period from 1 April 2021 to 30 June 2021) and the contact research (for the period from 1 April 2021 to 31 May 2021) to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.The local government may, in accordance with Article 5 of this Decision, terminate this period early after an evaluation of the state of progress of the COVID-19 epidemic by the Flemish Government.In accordance with Article 28 (3) of Regulation (EU) No 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and to the processing of personal data, the local authorities may, in accordance with Article 5 of this Decision, take the following measures:2° providing medical and psychosocial support to quarantine coaching by COVID-19 (Article 44 of the Decree of 21 November 2003 on preventive health policy and Article 2 (2) of the Decree of 22 December 2017 on local governance); 3° detecting COVID-19 hotspots, to then isolate them and ultimately restrict them (Article 44 of the Decree of 21 November 2003 on preventive health policy and Article 2 (1) of the Decree of 22 December 2017 on local governance); 4° detecting vulnerable persons or groups in the context of the fight against COVID-19 pandemic (Article 2 (1) of the Decree of 22 December 2017 on local governance); 5° after being explicitly authorised by the person concerned, the provision of tailored support in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.In order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the first place, or in accordance with Article 3, § 1, 1°, of the Flemish Government's decision of 23 April 2021 granting a grant to local authorities to strengthen the source detection and contact research to combat COVID-19 pandemic, it is sufficient to submit an addendum to the cooperation agreement referred to in Article 10, 2°, of the Flemish Government's decision of 13 November 2020 granting a grant to local authorities to strengthen the contact and source detection to combat COOVID-19 pandemics.Article 13.
