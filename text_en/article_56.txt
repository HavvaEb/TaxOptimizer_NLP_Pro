Tax of non-residents (natural persons). - Notice to employers who pay remuneration to non-residents and who work as seasonal workers in agriculture and horticulture Legal provisions Article 7 of the Law of 21 January 2022 laying down various tax provisions (BS 28.01.2022), hereinafter W 21.01.2022, introduced the possibility of exempting the holding tax payable on remuneration of non-residents who work as seasonal workers in agriculture and horticulture. For the residents of a Member State of the European Economic Area, it is a system of choice, since they may opt to regularise their income by means of a declaration in the tax of non-residents (natural persons).Such a declaration is in line with the intention of the law, namely that the employer would know the address of the official residence of the worker in order to be able to fulfil his administrative obligations correctly. Such a declaration is required from tax year 2023 (revenue of the year 2022).Customities to be completed by the employer The legal text obliges the employer to provide a copy of the residence declaration to the tax administration by electronic means before 1 March of the year following the year of income. Since the law the Minister of Finance is responsible for determining the detailed rules for the delivery of these declarations, it is for pragmatic reasons and in order to alleviate the administrative formalities of the employer that the latter must keep the residence declarations at the disposal of the Belgian tax administration and transfer them to any request of that administration. Finally, the sheet 281.10 of the revenue of the year 2021 contains a new trade which allows the statement of remuneration of a non-resident in the country or horticulture subject to the exempt business tax.
