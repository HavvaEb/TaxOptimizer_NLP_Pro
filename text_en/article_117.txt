The Royal Decree amending certain deadlines laid down in the Royal Decree of 26 November 2013 in implementation of Article 191, § 3 of the Law of 26 December 2006 laying down various provisions as a result of the measures taken to limit the dissemination of the Coronavirus COVID-19 REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, The draft decision which we have the honour to submit for signature to Your Majesty aims to adapt the procedures relating to the training and involvement of certain risk groups, and to the primary prevention of burn-out, financed by a grant. These adjustments are necessary for the purpose of suspending the activities or changing working conditions of the beneficiaries of these grants as a result of the pandemic COVID-19. Article-by-way discussion As regards the projects risk groups Article 1 Article 1 is intended to postpone the deadline of the interim report for three months for the additional projects 2020-2021 for -26-year-olds of the risk groups. Actions and activities, which have been postponed by the COVID-19-pandmie, can be included in the interim report so again.It is therefore necessary to grant an additional period of 6 months (i.e. until 31 May 2021) in order to plan the following phases of the project and the assignments of the project supervisor as soon as possible. Articles 4 and 5 The extension by six months for the implementation of the projects made it necessary to adjust the other deadlines for the procedure. The specific entry into force of Article 2 is also justified by the fact that the grant applications for the period of six months must be extended for the same period of six months, namely: the deadline for the submission of the final evaluation report and the financial supporting documents, the period for the procedure for the payment of the grant and the period for the submission of the synthesis report by the experts.It is also justified by the fact that employers and sectors between 1 June and 31 July 2020 cannot submit projects for the prevention of burn-out.This Decision shall enter into force on the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
