Royal decision granting the status of the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic on the Belgian territory REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, The three draft decisions which I have the honour to submit to Your Majesty for signature are the first step in the support offered to hospitals in the fight against the coronavirus epidemic COVID-19 affecting Belgium. General hospitals and health care providers in hospitals are confronted with various additional costs or a decrease in income compared to their normal operation. It concerns costs related to the execution of the emergency plans which have a major unforeseen impact on normal activity, to additional costs for materials, personnel, changes of structure, etc., as well as to loss of income (honoraria, flats....) by the cancellation of scheduled interventions, both for patients included in the hospital and for the poor patients.On the basis of the financial resources of the hospitals or any other financing which falls within the competence of the RIZIV, and on the measures to be taken in the short and medium term within the framework of that same budget, an ad hoc working group composed of representatives of the hospital federations, representatives of the doctors' syndicates, specialists in hospitals, from the National Commission on Doctors' Funds and representatives of the insurance institutions, shall be required to give an opinion on the rules on regularization and on the measures to be taken in the short and medium term in the context of the sectors within the competence of the RIZIV. It should be noted that the first phase of granting an advance of one billion euros on the basis of which the sums to be recovered will not be reduced within the framework of the current medical care insurance scheme.In the present situation, however, the costs covered by the budget of the financial resources of the hospitals and giving rise to a concession are so high that the allowances are not at all sufficient to cover their extension to the financial resources of the hospitals. That article must therefore be adapted so that the costs normally borne but much higher than in a normal period can be borne by the budget of the hospitals' financial resources. That possibility depends on the determination by the King, in the Council of Ministers, of the decision and after the opinion of the High Health Council, of a state of epidemic or pandemic. The drafts submitted to you give you the opportunity to take all necessary legal and regulatory measures so that the advance can be paid at short notice and on the other grounds of the normal budget of the hospitals may be taken into consideration.The second draft of the Royal Decree amends Article 101 of the Coordinated Law of 10 July 2008 to the hospitals and other care institutions. Article 1 deletes the concept of 'forfaitous' coverage of the costs in order to take account of real costs which, on the basis of the opinions of the working groups, will be 'accepted' in the special circumstances attributable to the sanitary approach to the epidemic. The same article also removes the condition that the costs may not be covered by a government meeting. The third draft Royal Decree is the necessary condition for the application of the aforementioned Article 101, in particular the determination, made by the Council of Ministers and after the opinion of the High Health Council, of a state of epidemic in Belgium. I have the honour to be, Sire, Van Uwey, the very respectful and very faithful Dieto, the Minister of Social Affairs and Health, M. DE BLOCK COUNCIL OF STATE Department of Understanding 67.212/3 of 14 April 2020 on a draft of the Royal Decree on the condition of the Corona virus in Belgium.In accordance with Article 84, § 3, of the Laws of the State, the Court of Justice of the European Communities, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 1 of the Law of the Council of the European Communities, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of the Law of the European Communities, shall, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of the Law of the Council of the European Union, decide on the application of the first paragraph of Article 1 of the Law of the European Communities to the principle of equal treatment of men and women in matters relating to equal treatment of men and women in matters relating to equal treatment of men and women in matters relating to equal treatment of men and women in matters relating to equal treatment of men and women in matters relating to equal treatment of men and women in matters relating to equal treatment of men and women in matters relating to equal treatment of equal treatment of men and women in matters relating to equal treatment of men and women in matters relating to equal treatment of equal treatment of men and women in matters relating to equal treatment of equal treatment of men and women and to equal treatment of men and to equal treatment of men and to equal treatment of men and women and to equal treatment of men and to equal treatment of men and to equal treatment of men and to equal treatment of men and to men and women in matters.The following shall be added to the list in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Commission of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p.également ölimitante' car actuellement un groupe de travail du Conseil fédéral des Etablissements Hospitaliers est occupé à travailler pour établir les élémentes qui seront couverts en plus de ce qui est couvert en période normale d'activités hospitalières. Rien ne permet, à cestade, de conclure avec certitude que les couvertures les plus adéquates seront des forfaits (bien que l'idée n'est pas de couvrir à couvrir à coût réel non plus car cela impliquerait des las impliquerait des charges administratives trop importantes, tant pour les hôpitaux que pour les administrations)."Habituels" (financement de leur personnel, duomariel, de l'infrastructure, etc...), des surcoûts (achats en plus grand volume et à prix plus élevés, achat d'autre type de ötriel, etc...) et en même temps, hormis la partie fixe du BMF qui leur est acquise, leurs recettes sont fortement diminuées puisque leurs activités non essentiallles ont dû être mises à l'arrêt. Et donc, le troisième arrêté permet de doncer une réponse à court terme à ce problème de trésorrie en liquidant directement (et non étalé en douzième comme pour le BMF), un montant par hôpital permettant, de poument personson à compreson à compres à compresse de cours.However, from the date of entry into force of the decision to adopt the first paragraph of Article 101 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the Act of Accession of Spain to the Act of Accession of Spain and the Act of Accession of Spain to the Act of Accession of Spain and the Act of Accession of Spain to the Act of Accession of Spain and the Act of Spain to the Act of Accession of Spain and the Act of Accession of Spain to the Act of Accession of Spain and the Act of Spain to the Act of Accession of Spain and the Act of Spain to the Act of Accession of Spain and the Act of Spain to the Act of Spain and the Act of Spain to the Act of Accession of Spain to the Act of Spain to the Act of Spain to the Act of Accession of Spain and to the Act of Spain and the Act of Spain to the Act of Spain to the Act of Spain to the Act of Accession of Spain to the Act of Spain and to the Act of Spain to the Act of 1 JanuaryCOVID-19 epidemic on the Belgian territory of FILIP, King of Belgians, to all who are now and will be listed below, Our Greeting.
