CHAPTER 1 - Abolition of advance payment Article 53ocies, Paragraph 1, fourth paragraph of the VAT Code on value added tax delegates to the King the power to determine that the tax due for transactions carried out during the last declaration period of the calendar year is to be met before the expiry of that year. By this Royal Decree, the provisions of VAT KB No 1 of 29 December 1992 relating to the December advance payment by quarterly directors (Article 19, § 1) and by monthly administrator (Article 19, § 2) are hereby removed.The Royal Decree No 4 lays down, inter alia, the manner in which this application is to be made, the period for which the application may relate and also the minimum amount which the VAT balance must reach in order to be refundable. Those minimum amounts are currently fixed at: - EUR 245 if a refund is requested in the periodic declaration relating to the last declaration period of the calendar year (Article 81, § 2, 1°, of Royal Decree No 4); - EUR 615 if a refund is requested in the periodic declaration relating to each of the first three calendar calendar years by a quarterly administrator (Article 81, § 2, 2°, of Royal Decree No 4); - EUR 245 if a refund is requested in the periodic monthly declaration of monthly refunds (Article 81, § 2, 2°, of Royal Decree No 4); - EUR 245 if a refund is requested in the monthly declaration of a monthly refund is requested in the last periodic month of the Royal Decree No 4;In order for the taxable persons concerned to be able to benefit as soon as possible and before the first calendar quarter of 2021 from the reduced refund thresholds, Article 8 of the Royal Decree provides that these amendments will enter into force on 1 April 2021. As a result, taxable persons will be able to apply for VAT in their periodic declaration relating to the first quarter of 2021 or in the periodic declaration relating to the last month of that quarter, whichever is lower than the current threshold but above the new threshold. In order that the refund of such VAT credits by the taxable persons concerned may be effectively applied for by the taxable persons concerned, it is essential for them to know at the time of submission of the periodic declaration that they may now apply for VAT in accordance with Article 81 (4) of the Royal Decree No 4 above.In the light of the Royal Decree No 41 of 30 January 1987 fixing the amount of proportional tax fines in respect of the value added tax, the following sentence shall be substituted in the Annex to this Decision: "In the light of the opinion of the Inspector of Finance, given on 23 February 2021; In the light of the agreement of the State Secretary for Budget, given on 26 February 2021; In the light of the opinion of the Council of State, given on 25 March 2021, pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 1, paragraph 2°, of the Laws on the Council of State, coordinated on 12 January 1973; In the light of the regulatory impact analysis carried out in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of the Law of 15 December 2013 laying down various provisions on administrative simplification; On the proposal of the Minister of Finance, Hebben We decide and decide: CHAPTER 1. - Abolition of the payment of advances Article 19 of the Royal Decree No 1 of 29 December 1992 on the settlement of the value added tax, replaced by the Royal Decree of 16 February 2017,In Article 81 (2) of Royal Decree No 4 of 29 December 1969 concerning refunds on value added tax, as last amended by the Royal Decree of 29 August 2019, the following amendments shall be made: (a) in the provision under point 1°, the words "EUR 245" shall be replaced by the words "EUR 50" in the introductory phrase of the provision under point 3°; (b) in the provision under point 2°, the words "EUR 50"; (d) in the provision under point 4°, the words "EUR 245" shall be replaced by the words "EUR 50" in the introductory phrase of the provision under point 8.
