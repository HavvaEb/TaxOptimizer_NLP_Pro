The Royal Decree implementing Articles 18, 31, 33 and 47 of the Law of 20 December 2019 transposing Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/7/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation with regard to mandatory cross-border constructions REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, The draft royal decision which we have the honour to submit to Your Majesty for signature, aims to establish the scale of the applicable administrative fines in the event of infringements of additional reporting obligations imposed by the Law of 20 December 2019 on intermediaries and taxable persons concerned, concerning cross-border structures. In order to combat more aggressive tax practices more effectively, this law transposing the Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 into the Code of Income Tax 1992, the Code of various duties and taxes, the Code of Succession Rights and the Code of Registration, mortgage and Registry Rights, two categories of sanctions is inserted. On the one hand, in the case of incomplete provision by theThe Council of State may, with respect to the principle of proportionality (paragraph 6), make a comment on the possibility which might be given to the administration or court of a Member State to take account of mitigating circumstances in order to reduce the relatively high amount of the fine in the case of, for example, a spontaneous correction of an incorrect notification and thus to ensure the proportionality of the penalty. The Council of State has in this regard referred to the case-law of the Constitutional Court, in particular to judgment 8/2019 of 23 January 2019. The Constitutional Court indeed stresses that, if the offender can be imposed either a criminal fine or an administrative fine of a criminal nature, then in principle there must be a parallelism between the measures of individualisation of the penalty: if, for the same facts, the court may impose a criminal fine which is less than the legal minimum in the event of mitigating circumstances, it must in a civil proceedings against the imposition of an administrative fine, in principle have the same possibility.On 6 March 2020, the Council of State, Department of Legislation, requested by the Minister of Finance, within a period of 30 days, extended until 9 April 2020, to provide an opinion on a draft royal decision "to implement Articles 18, 31, 33 and 47 of the Act of 20 December 2019 transposing Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation relating to mandatory cross-border constructions'. The draft was examined by the Third Chamber on 26 March 2020. The Chamber was composed of Jo Baert, Chamber Chairman, Jeroen Van Nieuwenhove and Koen Muylle, State Councils, Jan Velaers and Bruno Peeters,assessors, and Annemie Goossens, Registrar. The report was issued by Frédéric Vanneste, first hearing officer. The agreement between the French and Dutch text of the opinion is subject to the supervision of Baert, Chamber Chairman.The first paragraph of Article 1 of the Act of 20 December 2019 provides that "the Commission shall, for the purposes of implementing Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/7/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation with regard to compulsory cross-border construction [s]." Articles 2 to 18 of that Act of 20 December 2019 have inserted into the Income Tax Code 1992 (hereinafter "WIB 92') articles relating to additional reporting obligations for intermediaries or relevant taxable persons in respect of cross-border constructions - see, in particular, Articles 36/1 to 326/11 of the WIB 92 - and its sanctioning. That latter provision constitutes the legal basis for Article 1 of the Decision. For the same purpose, similar arrangements are inserted into the Code of Registration, Hypothek and Griffine rights (Articles 19 to 32 of the Law of 20 December 2019), the Code of the Succession rights (Articles 33 to 46 of the Law of 20 December 2019), and the Law of 20 December 2019 (hereinafter "the Law of 20 December 2019).By the Royal Decree of 3 March 1927 that means that if the taxable person or another obliged person corrects an error - i.e. if before the tax administration intervenes he still complies with the obligation to notify or correct an incorrect notification - he is not entitled to receive the automatic remission. He replied: "The main purpose of the Law of 20 December 2019 transposing Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation with regard to compulsory cross-border constructions is to ensure that the tax authorities obtain in due time correct and complete information relating to cross-border constructions with a potentially aggressive character. In the Random Number 15 of the abovementioned Directive 2018/822 (Official Journal of the European Union of 5 June 2018) it is not possible to read that "the Member States should fix penalties for infringements of the national transposition provisions. Such penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive'.However, the possibility of taking into account mitigating circumstances makes it possible to monitor the proportionality of the penalty, which is all the more necessary if the penalties in question are to be particularly severe. Moreover, in general, the Constitutional Court has pointed out that, where the offender can be imposed on the same facts either a criminal fine or an administrative fine, there must in principle be a parallelism between the measures of individualisation of the penalty, for example, the possibility of taking into account mitigating circumstances: if for the same facts the court can impose a criminal fine less than the legal minimum if there are mitigating circumstances (2), then that possibility must also exist in relation to the imposition of an administrative fine. If that possibility is not provided for, that difference in treatment should be reasonably justified. (3) The agent is therefore asked whether the amount of the penalties may be reduced by the administration or by the court.Article 449 and Article 450 WIB92, Articles 206 and 206a of the Code of Registration, Mortgage and Registry Rights, Articles 133 and 133a of the Code of Succession Rights and Articles 207 and 207a of the Code of Various Rights and Charges apply to the provisions of this draft implementing Articles 445, Paragraph 4, third paragraph WIB 92, 289a/12, third paragraph of the Code of Registration, Mortgage and Registry Rights, 132, third paragraph of the Code of Succession Rights and 2062, third paragraph of the Code of Various Rights and Charges. It is clear that, in the present case, not every non-declaration or incorrect declaration of the Code of Registration, shall be subject to the conditions of the infringement of the principle of parallelism with criminal law.Advocate General F.G. Jacobs delivered his Opinion at the sitting of the Full Court on 18 March 2001.(2) Pursuant to Article 457, Paragraph 1 of the WIB 92, Article 85 of the Criminal Code (the penalties may be reduced for mitigating circumstances) applies to the offences referred to in Articles 449 to 453 and 456 of the WIB 92.
