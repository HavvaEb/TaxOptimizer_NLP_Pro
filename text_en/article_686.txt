DAERDEN _______ Notes * The theoretical number of sanitary facilities obtained for the female population is rounded to the higher unit, just like the number obtained for the male population. The two thus obtained numbers are then added together. ** For the establishments with different departments, the school population must be reported per department. If the playing times for the different departments are organized separately, the number of pupils in the largest department is taken into account. Unless one of the departments includes nursery education with adapted sanitary facilities. In this case, the number of pupils in all departments is taken into account. Each individual index is plundered on 1 in order not to compensate for a defect in one element with a surplus in the other.
