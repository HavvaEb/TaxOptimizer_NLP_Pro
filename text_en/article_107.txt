Decision of the Government of the French Community of special powers No 34 derogating from certain provisions relating to the steering of the education system in the context of the COVID health crisis-19 The Government of the French Community, Having regard to the Decree of 17 March 2020 granting special powers to the Government in the context of the health crisis in connection with the COVID-19 coronavirus, Article 1 (1) (a) and (g); Having regard to the Decree of 24 July 1997 laying down the priority tasks of primary education and secondary education and the structures enabling them to be implemented, Article 67; Having regard to the Decree of 13 September 2018 establishing the General Steering Service for the Schools and psycho-medical-social centres and determining the status of the zonal directors and delegates for the objectives agreement,the time limits and procedures for the submission of the steering plans of the schools of the second cohort which must draw up a steering plan for the purpose of concluding a target agreement (hereinafter referred to as the second cohort) after the beginning of the school year in September 2020, with the aim of adapting the situation of the schools of the second cohort which would have submitted a management plan by 30 April 2020;Since the Minister of Education has decided, following this ministerial decision, to extend the time limit for submission of the guidance plans for the schools of the 2nd cohort by 15 days of school work from 30 April 2020, i.e. until 26 May 2020, by means of a letter; whereas at this moment the priority objective of the schools is to maintain optimal safety conditions within each school, so that the lessons can be continued in part and progressively, as well as the organisation of the end of the school year; whereas in order to enable the schools to achieve this priority objective, it is therefore necessary to give them additional time to prepare their steering plan for their normal activities; whereas the absence of an extension of the period for submission of the time would lead to an urgent submission and thus to the new steering of the Excellence Pact for Education would be seriously endangered; whereas the time period for submission of the steering plans should therefore be postponed to a period after the school year of September 2020, when the school's normal activities would be resumed in accordance with Article 6;It is recommended that the time-limit for the analysis of the steering plan be suspended for all schools which would submit the plan before the time-limit extended by this Decision and that the plan be put into effect on the first day following the expiry of that period, namely 13 October 2020; whereas all the time-limits set out in Article 67, Paragraph 6, of the Act of Accession are therefore deferred from that date of 12 October 2020; whereas the target contract is implemented by 1 September following its signature; whereas, however, if the target contract is not concluded before 1 September, it shall be implemented by 1 January following its signature; whereas the schools which may conclude a contract without receiving reasoned recommendations will implement their target contract as from 1 January 2021, as provided for in the contract decree, i.e. less than two years after the start of the stage of preparation of the steering plans of the 2nd cohort schools; whereas, for the schools which will receive reasoned recommendations from their representative to the objectives contract, the date of implementation of the contracts should be reviewed, in order to avoid the time-limiting of the contract, i.e.e.Since the IFC, the trainers and the members of the General Steering Service for the schools and psycho-medical-social centres are jointly of the opinion that certain parts of the modules constituting the basic training should be followed in the classroom in order to deepen the knowledge acquired and to ensure the quality of the training given; whereas in order to avoid a serious risk that the follow-up of the initial training will be at odds with one another, it is necessary to postpone 53 hours of initial training, which should be organized in the presence of the persons concerned for the zone directors and 43 hours for the delegates of the target contract; whereas the hours in the presence of the persons concerned of the necessary basic training will be organized at a time when the organisation of sessions in the presence of the persons concerned will be allowed, after the containment, and when the DCOs and DZs concerned will be available, after the annual summer holidays and prior to the analysis of the training plans of the second cohorts, to be postponed after 12 October 2020 by the present decree;Whereas Article 144 (2) of the DCO/DZ Decree also provides that DCO and DZ trainees are to be subject to two service assessments during their internship; whereas the first evaluation is to take place between the fourth and sixth months of the internship and therefore between June and August 2020; whereas the postponement of the submission of the guidance plans for the schools of the second cohort and thus the postponement of the contractualisation for those schools implies that the DCOs and DZ's of the second recruitment wave between June and August 2020 has not yet taken part in the contractualisation of the schools with the regulatory authority; whereas that this activity is their main mission in accordance with Articles 5 and 7 of the DCO/D-DE; whereas, therefore, their experience in the case of these schools is not to be regarded as being very limited by the same criteria and that it is to be assessed by the conclusion that, in the case of the second assessment of the- Articles 2 and 3 which enter into force on 30 April 2020, as they depart from that date for the submission of guidance plans by schools; - Article 4 which enters into force on 30 April, since it is necessary to complete the analysis by the delegates of the objectives agreement of the management plans of that date until 13 October 2020; - Article 7 which departs from the period within which the initial training of the zone directors (stagiaires since 9 March 2020) and the delegates for the objectives agreement (stagiaires since 16 March 2020) for the purposes of the decision of 17 March 2020 granting special powers to the government in the context of the health crisis in connection with the COVID-19 coronavirus, the first referred to in Article 1 may be adopted in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 1 of the Act of Accession of the Convention (stagiaires since 16 March 2020).By way of derogation from Article 1 (2) of the Code of Conduct, the schools shall, on the basis of Article 1 (2) of the Code of Conduct, submit to the Commission, on the basis of Article 1 (2) of that Protocol, the first subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of the Code of Conduct, the first subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of the Code of Conduct, the first subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 2 of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 2 of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 2 of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 3 of the Protocol, the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Protocol, the second subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of the Protocol, the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Protocol, the Protocol, the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Protocol, the Protocol, the first paragraph of Article 2 of Article 2 of the Protocol, the Protocol, the first paragraph of Article 2 of Article 2 of Article 2 of Article 2 of the said Article 2 of the Protocol and the first paragraph of the first paragraph of the first paragraph of Article 2 of the first paragraph of Article 2 of Article 2 of Article 2 of the said Article 2 of the said Article 2 of the said Article 2 of the said Article 2 of the said Article 2 of the Protocol, the Protocol, the Protocol, the first paragraph of the first paragraph of the first paragraph of Article 2 of Article 2 of Article 2 of Article 2 of the first paragraph of the Protocol, the first paragraph of the first paragraph of Article of Article of the Protocol, the Protocol, the first paragraph of the first paragraph of the first paragraph of the first paragraph of the first paragraph of the first paragraph of the first paragraph of Article 2 of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article 2 of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article 2 of Article 2 of Article of Article 2 of Article 2 of Article 2 of Article 2 of Article 2 of Article 2 of the first paragraph of the first paragraph of Article of this Article of Article of Article of Article of Article ofArticle 10.
