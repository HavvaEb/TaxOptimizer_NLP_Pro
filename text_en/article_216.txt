Royal Decree amending the KB/WIB 92 in respect of the exemption from the transfer of pre-taxes pursuant to Article 275 12 of the Code of Income Tax 1992 REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, a tax advantage is introduced for companies which grant their employees more hours of training than is regulated by the rules.
