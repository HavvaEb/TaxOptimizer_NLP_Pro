Royal Decree No 39 amending the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 establishing the list of occupational diseases giving rise to compensation and determining the criteria to be met by exposure to the occupational risk for some of these diseases by virtue of COVID-19 REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, The Royal Decree of which we have the honour to submit to your Majesty for signature, has as its objective, on the basis of the Law of 27 March 2020 authorising the King to take measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 (II), to take urgent measures for workers in companies of the crucial sectors and essential services which have continued their professional activities without being able to comply with the rules of social discrimination or to operate without being able to teleworking in the period from 18 March 2020 to 17 May 2020.The Minister of Social Affairs therefore asked the Management Committee for the occupational diseases of Fedris in March to examine whether the list of persons eligible for compensation for occupational disease after exposure to COVID-19 could be extended and under what conditions.The Minister of Civil Service also asked to take into account persons who are employed in the public sector.The Management Committee has considered this and proposed possible extensions.The purpose of this decision is therefore to temporarily introduce, within the framework of the special powers granted by the above-mentioned Act of 27 March 2020, an exemption scheme to allow the recognition of COVID-19 as an occupational disease for workers in companies of the crucial sectors and the essential services which have had to continue their professional activities without being able to teleworking and without being able to comply with the rules of social discrimination.In the light of the exceptional situation in which it is possible, in the light of the nature of the case, to determine the extent to which the provisions laid down in the first paragraph of Article 36 are to be complied with, it is necessary, for example, to observe a distance of 1,5 m from other persons.Article 1 of the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 establishing the list of occupational diseases giving rise to compensation and determining the criteria to which the occupational risk for some of these diseases must be re-examined or even reformed, taking into account the new criteria which will be taken into account for the purposes of the Decision of 28 March 1969 on the basis of Article 1 of the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 establishing the list of occupational diseases giving rise to compensation and determining the criteria to which the occupational risk for some of these diseases must be re-examined or even reformed, taking into account the new diseases which we will have to deal with in the futureOn 12 June 2020, the Council of State, Department of Legislation, requested by the Minister of Social Affairs, within a period of five working days, to provide an opinion on a draft Royal Decree No... 'to amend the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 establishing the list of occupational diseases which give rise to compensation and establishing the criteria to be met by exposure to occupational risks for some of these diseases due to COVID-19'. The draft was examined by the First Chamber on 16 June 2020. The Chamber was composed of Marnix VAN DAMME, Chairman of Chamber, Wilfried VAN VAERENBERGH and Chantal BAMPS, State Councils, and Wim GEURTS, Registrar. The report was issued by Barbara SPEYBROUCK, First Auditor. The agreement between the French and the Dutch text of the opinion is based on the text of Chantal BAMPS, State Council. The text of which follows, is given on 19 June 2020.For some of these diseases, a new code number shall be introduced in order to cover the workers concerned for the specified period (Article 1 of the draft); Articles 36, second paragraph, and 52, fourth paragraph, of the 'Laws on the prevention of occupational diseases and the compensation of damage resulting from those diseases, coordinated on 3 June 1970' (hereinafter referred to as the Occupational Diseases Act) shall not apply in the context of the recognition of that new code (Article 2); in the Annex to the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969, the criteria for exposure to the new code (Article 3) shall be inserted and the King shall be authorised until 31 December 2020 to extend the application of the proposed decision to other periods of exercise of a professional activity by the workers concerned if new lockdown measures are imposed (Article 4).In addition to the existing authorisations already provided for in the legislation in force, the government will be able to act quickly within its sphere of competence, by taking direct or indirect aid measures which include accompanying measures, such as deferment or guarantee schemes, and it was also pointed out in the explanatory memorandum that in the field of labour law and social security law there may be situations where the existing legal framework does not permit the compatibility of the public health measures with the need for continued economic production or services, both in the private sector and in the public sector, for example because of the telework imposed or the changes in the hourly schedule.On the basis of Article 32, third paragraph, of the same law for certain occupational diseases and for diseases referred to in Article 30a of that law lay down exposure criteria, on a proposal from the Management Committee and after consulting the Scientific Council, the purpose of the proposed scheme is to introduce a temporary derogation scheme for the recognition of each disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 as an occupational disease for workers in the critical sectors and essential services which during the lockdown period had to continue their occupational activities without being able to telework and without being able to comply with the rules of social distancing and in respect of which exposure criteria are laid down.It is necessary to examine whether the abovementioned differences in treatment with regard to efficiency, objectivity, pertinence and proportionality can be considered to be consistent with the principle of legal equality and non-discrimination laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, in order to be justified in the light of the principle of equal treatment laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and in the light of the principle of equal treatment laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, in the light of the principle of equal treatment laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, in the light of the principle of equal treatment laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, in the light of the principle of equal treatment laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and in the light of the principle of equal treatment laid down in Article 2 of the principle of equal treatment laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71.* Article 52, alinéa 4 qui doctuule que '(...Toutefois, en cé concern les cas d'incapacité tempéraires, de la réparation à partir de la la la réparation à la la de la maladie a été incrite'; * Article 52, alinéa 4 qui doctule que 'Lorsque l'incapacité temporaire ou le décès sont antérieurs à la maladie sur la liste visée à l'article 30, la victime ou ses ayants droit peuvent prétendre à réparation à partir de la de la la de la maladie a été inscrite'; * Article 52, alinéa 4 qui doctuaire que '(......)résultant du décès ne pourrait débuter qu'à partir de la date d'entrée en vigueur de l'arrêté insérant le nouveau code au sein de la liste des malades professionnelles. S'agissant d'un régime temporaire justifié par des considérations exceptionnelles, l'application de ces règles doit être écartée, sauf à priver la propositione d'une grande part de son utilité attdue. Par ailleurs, parce qu'ils sont prés dans le cadre de mesures temporaires et provisoires de pouvoirs spéciaux il a été jugégépérable de ne pas intégrérer l'écartement temporaire de ces de cesux dispositions l'AR de pas pour les pas et pas.The first paragraph of Article 4 of the draft provides that, by 31 December 2020, the King may, by means of a decision adopted by the Council, extend to other periods of professional activity in companies of the crucial sectors and the essential services which are subject to the conditions laid down in the second and third criteria.The first paragraph of Article 3 of Protocol No 1 to the Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part, to the other part.See, for example, GwH 17 July 2014, No 107/2014, No B.12; GwH 25 September 2014, No 141/2014, No B.4.1; GwH 30 April 2015, No 50/2015, No B.16; GwH 18 June 2015, No 91/2015, No B.5.1.; GwH 16 July 2015, No 104/2015, No B.6. 7 See also Fedris's opinion of 13 May 2020 (p. 7-8). 26 JUNE 2020. - Royal Decree No 39 amending the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 laying down the list of occupational diseases which give rise to compensation and determining the criteria to be met by which exposure to the occupational risk for some of these diseases on behalf of COVID-19 FILIP, King of Belgium, To all who are now and hereafter are to be considered, Our Regret.Article 1 of the Royal Decree of March 1969 laying down the list of occupational diseases which give rise to compensation and to the determination of the criteria to which the occupational risks to be met by certain occupational diseases within the meaning of Article 2 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and Article 2 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and Article 2 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 are subject to the conditions laid down in Article 2 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and Article 2 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 of 21 December 1971 on the application of Article 2 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 of 21 December 1971 on the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to selfemployed persons, to selfemployed persons, to selfemployed persons, to selfemployed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons and to self-employed to self-employed persons, and to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed to self-employed to self-employed to self-employed to self-employed to self-employed to self-employed persons, to self-employed persons, to self-employed to self-employed to self-employed to self-employed-employed to self-employed, to self-employed to self-employed, to self-employed to self-employed to self-employed or to self-employed to self-employed or to self-employed or to beMaking it regularly impossible to keep a distance of 1.5 metres in contacts with other persons - no more than 14 days have elapsed between the occurrence of the disease and the date of the last actual work of the worker outside the home - and no more than 14 days have elapsed between the occurrence of the disease and the date on which the undertaking in which the worker ceased to perform his professional activity was included in the Annex to the Ministerial Decree of 23 March 2020.'
