Royal Decree No 34 implementing Article 5, § 1, 1°, 2°, and 6° of the Law of 27 March 2020 authorizing the King to take measures to combat the spread of the Coronavirus COVID-19 (II), with a view to ensuring and managing the stocks of medicinal products and extending the pharmacy licences REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, I hereby have the honour to present a draft royal decision implementing Article 5, § 1, 1°, 2°, and 6° of the Law of 27 March 2020 authorising the King to take measures to combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic currently affecting our country, with a view to ensuring the proper management of the stocks of medicinal products and extending the pharmacy authorisations.In view of the nature of this exceptional provision of a non-regulated medicinal product, the responsibilities of the health care professionals concerned are laid down in this framework. Finally, the validity of establishment permits is extended in order to enable holders to use it. These authorisations concern the transfer of a pharmacy or the merger of pharmacies, and so that the holder can make use of them, construction or conversion works are in many cases necessary. The Agency notes that many licensees, due to the reduced economic activity, come into difficulty and should again apply for a licence without extending the validity of those authorisations. The Council of State gave its opinion on the draft on 17 June 2020. These delegations do not concern the Minister or his delegate (non-regulatory) technical information and modalities (such as under other the retention conditions of the medicinal product concerned), which are contained in Articles 2, (3) and (4), (4) (2) (2) (2) of the draft regulation.On 16 June 2020, the Chamber was composed of Jo Baert, Chairman of the Chamber, Jeroen Van Nieuwenhove and Koen Muylle, State Councils, Jan Velaers and Bruno Peeters, assessors, and Annemie Goossens, Registrar.The alternative offered by the hospital pharmacist to a doctor for the distribution of the alternative to the hospital pharmacy or to the pharmacy opened to the public (Article 3). The alternative provided by the hospital pharmacist must be prescribed by a doctor and administered in the hospital or in the context of a hospital treatment of COVID-19 (Article 4). The (hospital) pharmacist must indicate the alternatives in the register and, at the request of the FAGG, communicate the state of consumption of the alternatives (Article 5) rules on the responsibility of the Belgian State, the (hospital) pharmacist and the prescriber for the alternatives (Article 6) and on the reporting of suspected serious or unexpected adverse reactions and suspicions of counterfeits or quality defects (Article 7). The supervision and detection of infringements by staff of the FAGG are regulated (Article 8), as well as the criminal penalties for such infringements (Article 9).In order to enable Belgium to react to the COOVID-19 epidemic or pandemic and to cope with its consequences, the measures taken to prevent the further spread of the COOVID-19 coronavirus among the population, including the maintenance of public health and public order (1°), to safeguard or provide additional (2°) security of supply necessary logistical and reception capacity, and to suspend or extend the time limits laid down by the law in accordance with the time limits laid down by the King, in accordance with Article 5 (2) of that law, shall not be adopted by the Commission.Article 5 (1) of Directive 2001/83/EC states that: "Article 5 (1) of Directive 2001/83/EC shall, in accordance with the laws in force and in order to meet special needs, not apply the provisions of this Directive to medicinal products supplied following a bona fide order on its own initiative by an officially recognized health professional, and which are prepared in accordance with its specifications and are intended for use by patients who are directly responsible for its personal responsibility." Member States may temporarily authorise the distribution of medicinal products for which no marketing authorisation has been granted to them, in order to prevent the alleged or established spread of pathogens, toxins or nuclear radiation which may cause harm."On the basis of Article 5 (1) of Directive 2001/83, it follows from Article 5 (1) of Directive 2001/83, read in the light of the essential objectives of this Directive, in particular the protection of public health, that the exception provided for in that provision may only apply to situations in which the doctor considers that the health condition of his own patients requires him to be administered to a medicinal product which is not available on the national market and of which there is no equivalent on that market' (r.o. 36, we sublines) It is not necessary at any time for the doctor to define the composition of the medicinal product in detail in accordance with that provision.The Dutch, French, English and German language versions of that provision clearly state that the objective stated therein (to counter the alleged or observed spread of pathogens, toxins, chemical agents or nuclear radiation which may cause damage) does not apply to the medicinal products themselves, but rather to the granting of temporary authorisation for the distribution of non-approved medicinal products. Medicinal products for the treatment of COOVID-19 patients can indeed contribute to the prevention of the spread of COOVID-19, if only because there seems to be evidence that cured patients are no longer able to develop the disease and cannot continue to spread it by contributing to the increase of group immunity. (3) In view of the apparently scarce practice of applying these two provisions of the directive and the resulting uncertainty of its use in this particular case, however, it is highly advisable to question the European Commission on the possibility of such provisions, in particular since it makes reference to similar initiatives in other Member States for which are likely to be compatible with European law. (4) The TRIS notification to this Article 2 of this Decision does not apply to the principle.However, as regards the delegations in Article 7 (2), second and third paragraphs of the draft, and as for the delegations in Article 2 (1) and (2) of the draft, which are individual decisions which do not contain general rules. 7.2. However, as regards the delegations in Article 2 (3) and (4), second paragraph of the draft, the Council of State is still in a position to question that they relate to individual decisions in so far as they relate to general rules, even if they relate to a specific medicinal product (or rather: alternative), which apply to all prescription doctors and to all pharmacists who make it available to the Minister.Article 6 of the draft Article 6 of the draft Article 6 of the draft Article 6 contains a number of provisions on the responsibility of the Belgian State, the apothecary, the apothecary and the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothetic, the apothebry, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothecary, the apothe apothescary, the apothescary, the apothetary, the apothes, theArticle 11 17.1. The retroactive effect until 13 March 2020 granted by Article 11 (1) of the draft law to Articles 1 to 7 of the decision to be taken shall be justified by the agent as follows: "Article 2 (2) of the law of 27 March 2020 permits the retroactive effect, which may not go beyond 1 March 2020, of the measures to be taken under this law. On the one hand, it is appropriate to regularise these justified measures and, on the other hand, to regulate possible new exceptional measures in the event of a second or third outbreak." The retroactive effect until 13 March 2020 granted to Article 11 (3) of the draft decision to be adopted by the authorised authority as follows:In the light of the exceptional circumstances of the present case, Article 1 to 7 of the Decision does not provide for the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women and women in matters relating to equal treatment for men and women and women in matters of equal treatment for men and women in matters of equal treatment for men and women in matters of equal treatment for men and women and women in matters in matters relating to women and men and women and women and women and women and women and women in matters in matters relating to equal treatment in matters relating to women in matters of equal treatment for women in matters of equal treatment in matters of equal treatment in matters of equal treatment for women in matters relating to women in matters of equal treatment for women in matters of equal treatment for women in matters of equal treatment for women and women in matters of equal treatment for women and women in matters in matters of equal treatment for women in matters of women and women and women in matters of women in matters in matters in matters in matters in matters in matters in matters of women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women in matters in matters of women in matters of women in matters of women in matters of women in matters of women in matters of women in matters in matters in matters in matters in matters of women and women and women in matters of women in matters of women and women and women and women and women in matters of women in matters of women in matters of women in matters of women in matters3 The preparatory work of the Directive does not allow the exact purpose of the Directive to be clarified. The amendment adopted by the European Parliament 24, which led to the second paragraph cited, does not contain any further explanation in this respect (report of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, A5-0340/2002, 15-16), whereas the amended proposal of the Commission, which included that amendment, does not mention the "strengthening of means to respond to the threat of bioterrorist attacks" (COM(2003) 163 final, 3-4). However, it cannot be inferred from the recent communication of the Commission of 8 April 2020 ("Guidelines on the optimal supply of medicinal products to prevent deficits during the outbreak of COVID-19," C(2020) 2272 final) all the relationship to the obligation of principle in Directive 2001/83/EC is not taken into account. 5 In the recent communication of the Commission of 8 April 2020 ("Guidelines on the optimal and rational supply of medicinal products to prevent deficits during the outbreak of COVID-19, C(2020) 2272 final.On 28 May 2020, having regard to the agreement of the Minister of Budget given on 5 June 2020; considering the regulatory analysis carried out pursuant to Articles 6 and 7 of the Law of 15 December 2013 laying down various provisions on administrative simplification; having regard to the opinion of the Council of Finance, given to the opinion of the Finance Inspectorate given on 28 May 2020; having regard to the opinion of the Minister of Budget given on 5 June 2020; having regard to the impact analysis of the regulations carried out pursuant to Articles 6 and 7 of the Law of 15 December 2013 laying down various provisions on administrative simplification; having regard to the opinion of the Council of Finance, given on 28 May 2020; having regard to the opinion of the Council of Finance,The Minister may also designate as a Member of the Minister other servants of the FAGG on behalf of the Member State concerned, with reference to the border of the Member State concerned.By way of derogation from the first paragraph of this paragraph, the Minister or his delegate may determine the conditions and arrangements under which the hospital pharmacist may provide an alternative within the framework of a hospitalized or outpatient treatment of COVID-19.
