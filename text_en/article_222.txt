Royal Decree No 44 concerning the joint processing of data by Sciensano and the contact centres designated by the competent regional authorities or by the competent agencies, health inspections and mobile teams in the context of a contact investigation in persons (suspectively) infected with the coronavirus COVID-19, based on a database at Sciensano REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, In the context of the COOVID-19 health crisis in Belgium, the Royal Decree No 18 of 4 May 2020 of Sciensano, the Belgian Institute of Public Health, established a database which contains specific information necessary for the detection and contact of the persons concerned, for the execution of scientific, statistical and/or policy-support studies and for the fulfilment of the tasks of the health inspection services of the communities and regions in the framework of initiatives to extend harmful effects caused by infectious diseases.In this respect, the Commission considers that, for the purposes of Article 4 of the Act of 25 February 2018 on the establishment of Sciensano', the legal basis of which is based on Article 20 of the Act of 25 February 2018 on the establishment of Sciensano'. The conclusion is therefore that the legislative proposal relates both to federal and to Community powers. Moreover, the two aspects of the proposed regulation appear to be closely linked. In its present form, the legislative proposal submitted for an opinion can only proceed if it is transformed into a cooperation agreement requiring parliamentary approval.' The Consultation Committee of 30 May 2020 took the following decision: "In the light of the opinion of the Council of State on the proposal for a research programme and the database has been decided to conclude a cooperation agreement'.On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) also declared the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the disease COVID-19, to be a pandemic. Also Belgium has not spared this pandemic. In the context of the COVID-19 health crisis and in order to prevent further spread of the disease, the National Security Council, which is in addition to the representatives of the federal government, representatives of the Länder, was instructed to take appropriate measures to limit the further spread of COVID-19. 1. General objectives The detection of the contacts of infected persons and the encouragement of these contacts to take the necessary measures to prevent new infections, which threaten public health, can be carried out in various ways. The most obvious methods are manual and digital contact detection. One of the necessary measures in the manual contact investigation is the early detection of persons who are infected with COVID-19 or whose serious suspicion exists with COVID-19.In addition, the transmission of personal data between different decentralised databases on a regular basis brings with it a much greater risk of data leaks. For these reasons, the advice of the Data Protection Authority to establish decentralised databases was not followed up. In order to ensure a safer and more efficient policy, this decision aims to provide the legal basis for this central database. This database at Sciensano, which is established by this Decision (hereinafter "Data Bank I'), will provide for the exchange of data with the databases established to support the competent regional authorities or by the competent agencies.With regard to the surveillance activities entrusted to Sciensano by Article 4 of the Law of 25 February 2018 on the establishment of Sciensano'. In order to meet the limitations on the effectiveness of the manual contact investigation, it is necessary to provide for additional ways of contact investigation. For example, it is not always possible to remember exactly with whom one has all been in contact over a certain period of time, let alone that of all those persons have the contact details. Therefore, in addition to the manual contact investigation in this Decision, a framework is provided for the digital contact investigation via a digital contact investigation application is possible. 2.Manual contact investigation In order to make the manual contact investigation as efficient as possible, the Databank I should also act as the central database in the fight against the dissemination of COOVID-19. Sciensano, as the data controller, manages data which contains personal data providers and caring institutions.In order to provide information on the persons with whom he has been in contact, it is not necessary to specify the circumstances in which such contact has taken place. A derogation from professional secrecy is provided for the following persons: - health care providers; - persons who have to maintain professional secrecy. In the case of healthcare providers, they are exempt from their obligation of professional secrecy when, on the one hand, they have to feed the Database I for the purposes provided for in this Decision, but, on the other hand, when the Contact Centre contacts them as (probably) infected persons, they are also exempt from their obligation of confidentiality when contacting them as (suspectably) infected persons, to provide information on the persons with whom they have been in contact.The data bank I shall then be fed with the data of the persons in contact with them, collected by the relevant contact centres. 3. The data collection and exchange of data between the competent health inspection services of the Länder in the framework of their missions and teams shall be provided, where necessary, with data from the data bank IV. The data bank I shall then be fed with the data of the persons in contact with them, which shall be collected by the relevant contact centres.In order to achieve this purpose of processing, it is also necessary to provide for the exchange of pseudonymized data between Database I and Database II. Categories of personal data collected under the present decision The categories of personal data collected are identification and contact details, test data, requirements, results of CT scans and suspected diagnoses of persons on the one hand, and data of the infected persons or persons seriously suspected of being infected as well as hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus at the hospitals on the other hand. A whole number of these data is collected by laboratories, triage posts, hospitals and doctors, CRAs (coordinated and advisory doctors) in the collections (e.g. housing centres, asylum centres and prisons).The fact that the whole health care system in Belgium is based on the use of the national register number to actually identify a patient is also necessary to process it within the manual contact investigation, with a view to the correct identification of the index person as well as of the persons with whom the index person has been in contact. Only to the extent strictly necessary for the realization of the processing purposes laid down in this Decision will the personal data collected also be linked to personal data from other databases, such as the Cross Point Registers, from which the correct identification data can be obtained, the Cobrha database with accurate identification data of the doctors and health institutions concerned and the database of the GMD holders be linked to personal data. A link with other personal data not necessary for those purposes is therefore not permitted (for example, the personal data may not be linked for tax purposes to personal data of the federal government Finance or for fraud prevention of personal data from other authentic sources).The person or the person of whom there is a serious suspicion that this person has already been in contact with the contact centres, the data of these persons shall be retained by the contact centres in order to ensure the further follow-up of these persons. For epidemiological purposes, it is also necessary to have information on the persons tested with negative results and the persons infected but no longer are. The first allows to draw useful conclusions on the relationship of negative test results versus positive test results, the second allows to draw conclusions on immunity among the population. The data collected by the mobile teams may also be disclosed to Sciensano to be stored in the data bank I for further processing and communication purposes only for the purposes specified in this Decision. In this Decision, only the categories of the personal data collected are listed, but already with a non-limitative list of the personal data covered by the relevant category in order to increase the transparency of the data in this context.The competent regional authorities or contact centre designated by the competent agencies shall receive this information from the Database I at Sciensano. If it concerns contacts with persons in a collectivity with a vulnerable population, then the contact centre shall contact the reference doctor, or in the absence thereof, the administrative manager of that collectivity for further monitoring of the situation. If it concerns contacts with individual persons, the contact centre shall then contact the individual persons by telephone, give them, on the basis of the information they provide, the appropriate recommendations (stay at home, work at home, allow themselves to be tested,...) and confirm these recommendations electronically. This electronic consignment shall only confirm the recommendations given orally. Similarly, field researchers may make physical visits to the persons concerned, where telephone or electronic contact is impossible. Mobile teams and health inspection services of the physically competent Länder or competent agencies shall have access to the data in the Databank I for the purposes of the purposes of contact investigation provided by this Decision; it is also possible that, within the framework of their respective regional powers, in the context of initiative, in the context of harmful effects caused by the information to be used by theThe purpose of the information committee's deliberations shall be limited only to the (electronic) exchange of data. In its deliberations, the Information Security Committee shall be bound by the legal provisions relating to the processing purposes of the bodies receiving the data. The deliberations of the Information Security Committee shall not constitute a legal basis for the first collection and processing of personal data by a body processing personal data on the basis of legitimate purposes for which it is empowered to communicate such personal data to other bodies. The deliberations of the Information Security Committee shall not constitute a legal basis for the first collection and processing of personal data by the body providing personal data on the basis of legitimate purposes for which it is empowered to communicate such personal data to other bodies.(ii) the categories of information providers who are required to communicate personal data to Sciensano for storage and further processing of them in the central database and (iii) the categories of personal data included in the data banks I, II, III and IV may be amended or supplemented by a royal decision adopted by the King after consultation in the Council and in the Interministerial Conference Public Health Committee.The pseudonimized data contained in the Databank II for scientific research is erased in accordance with the law of 10 April 2014 laying down various health provisions and the cooperation agreement concluded in its implementation between the RIZIV and Sciensano. Personal data from Database III are erased daily and personal data in database IV are either updated or erased every 10 years. The personal data received shall in any case be erased by the controller five days after the day on which this Decision ceases to have effect, in particular on 20 October 2020. Communication to the citizen should be concise, transparent and understandable, and this at various levels. When contacting the data subject through the contact centres shall be transparent in relation to the processing of personal data.In addition, the transmission of any identified contamination is voluntary.The promotion of a wide use by citizens of the same digital contact search application developed in accordance with the principle of data protection -by-design, is thus a measure fully consistent with the principle laid down in the General Data Protection Regulation which states that it is to be chosen for measures which allow for the attainment of specified objectives in the most effective manner and in a way which is least invasive in terms of the right to privacy.All digital contact detection applications used in Belgium, within the framework of the contact detection of the authorities, should be based on the DP3T system, an open-source system developed by a pan-European group of actors specialising in inter alia encryption, information security, privacy and epidemiology, and also used in other European countries.This should ensure that the interference on the basis of private life of theThis Decision provides that Sciensano shall be responsible for the processing of the central log list. Sciensano shall ensure that the necessary technical and organisational measures have been taken to protect the log list, and that the log list is not crossed with other databases.a digital contact investigation application, in particular Articles 6, § 1, e) and 9, § 2 (i) of the General Data Protection Regulation.This decision therefore does not rely on the specific legal basis.This decision provides the legal basis for achieving the following objectives: firstly, a digital contact investigation application should not register contacts between users in an automated manner without thereby being able to identify the users; secondly, a digital contact investigation application should give the user of which the COOVID-19 infection has been established the possibility to voluntarily report that he/she is infected with COOVID-19, and this in an authorised and controlled way to prevent any incorrect or false notification;.This legal framework should then allow the notification of the contamination to allow other users who have come into contact with the COVID-19 infected user during the period of the infected user to be in contact with the person in the vicinity of this infected person, without being transferred the name, location or exact time of contamination.For the purposes of this Decision, and for the purposes of this Decision, the Commission shall, in accordance with Article 4 (1) of the Law of 25 February 2018 establishing the Sciensano Joint Undertaking, provide that this institution shall, at the same time as at the level of the federal, regional and Community level, as well as at the European and international level, carry out certain health tasks, in particular scientific research and risk assessment; whereas it shall determine the categories of data, both personal data and non-identifiable data, which may be processed by a digital contact restriction application;- Royal Decree No 44 concerning the joint processing of data by Sciensano and the contact centres designated by the competent regional authorities or by the competent agencies, health inspections and mobile teams in the context of a contact investigation in persons (suspectively) infected with the coronavirus COVID-19 on the basis of a database at Sciensano FILIP, King of Belgium, to all who are now and will be responsible for the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data;in connection with the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC; having regard to the decree of the Flemish Parliament of 21 November 2003 concerning preventive health policy; having regard to the decree of 2 May 2019 amending the Walloon Code of Social Action and Health as regards the prevention and promotion of health; having regard to the decree of the Flemish Parliament of 29 May 2020 concerning the organisation of the reporting and contact investigation under COVID-19; having regard to the decision of the United College of the Joint Community Commission of 23 April 2009 on prophylaxis against communicable diseases; having regard to the decision of the Flemish Government of 19 June 2009 concerning initiatives to combat the spread of harmful effects caused by biotic factors; having regard to the decision of the Walloon Government of special powers No 35 of 5 May 2020 concerning the organisation of the contact tracing in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic; having regard to the decision of the Government of the German Community of 7 May 2020 on the establishment of a contact centre on the basis of theWhereas, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus a pandemic; whereas, in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis and in order to limit further spread of the disease of COVID-19, the National Security Council, which included, in addition to the representatives of the federal authorities, also representatives of the Länder, was required to take appropriate measures to limit the further spread of the disease of COVID-19; whereas one of those necessary measures is the early detection of persons in contact with persons infected with COVID-19 or of which there is a serious suspicion that they are contaminated with COVID-19, as well as the detection of the collectivity of such persons in order to prevent the use of such persons for the purpose of the treatment of theIn addition, it may freely grant the Communities access to such a database, as is already the case for other federal databases such as the Crossroads Bank of Social Security; on the proposal of the Minister for Social Affairs and Public Health and on the opinion of Our Ministers meeting in Council, have decided and decide We: CHAPTER I. - General provision Article 1. § 1.
