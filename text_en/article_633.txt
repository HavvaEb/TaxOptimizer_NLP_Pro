For the proposed scheme, legal basis shall be derived from Articles 129, 1° and 130 of the Law of 17 March 2019, on the basis of which the King is authorised to determine the date on which the law of 22 April 1999 is to continue to apply.It is also stated in the Royal Decree of 28 November 2018 that the rules governing the organisation and operation of the Professional Institute of Approved Accountants and Fiscalists shall continue to apply to the same date in the Royal Decree of 28 November 2018 that, when an appeal is brought after the entry into force of the Act, the new regulation of the Law of 17 March 2019 applies to the Board of Appeal and that, in the context of the entry into force of the Act, nowhere is expressly provided that the new institute must provide the necessary means for the performance of the tasks of the existing disciplinary bodies during the transitional period. Finally, it is stated in that opinion that, notwithstanding Article 122 of the Law of 17 March 2019, it is expressly stipulated that the pending disciplinary cases are to be dealt with by the disciplinary bodies "in the same composition', it cannot be deduced from this date that those authorities will continue to carry out their duties, even if the time for which the members of those bodies have been appointed in the meantime.On the basis of the above-mentioned opinion, which refers to the ambiguity of whether these are further treated by the existing bodies/committees, or whether these pending files are transferred for further treatment to the newly constituted bodies/committees, on the one hand, and on the other hand, to the newly constituted bodies/committees, on the other hand, and on the other hand, to the approach of the files on supervision and quality control pending with the merging institutes on the date of entry into force of the Act of 17 March 2019, the Delegate replied: "As long as the King fails to implement Article 60 of the Act of 17 March 2019, the current rules on quality testing (Royal Decree of 9 December 2019 establishing a quality review regulation of the external members of the Institute of Auditors and tax consultants and on the basis of further regulation of the use of the contract sheet) shall continue to apply. The quality review system provided for by the Act of 17 March 2019 builds on the existing system which applies today only to the members of the IAB.The IBA will have to provide the necessary measures and resources until the last BIBF-stagiaire has completed his internship in this way. The situation is different for the current IAB-members. For them, in fact, little or nothing changes. If the law of 17 March 2019 has amended, those provisions are intended to clarify the current rules without weighing them down" 5.4. In view of the above and for reasons of clarity and legal certainty, it is recommended that the authors of the draft supplement the proposed scheme with a transitional arrangement, which provides, on the one hand, for the files on disciplinary and quality control matters pending on the date of entry into force of the law of 22 April 1999, which will continue to be deal with by the disciplinary bodies and the merging institutes in their existing composition and, on the other hand, that the current IAB-stages may continue under the same conditions and rules by or for the implementation of the law of 22 April 1999, by which the bodies which are responsible for the follow-up of the IAB-stagiaires.Having regard to the Constitution, Article 108; Having regard to the Act of 17 March 2019 concerning the professions of accountants and tax advisors, Articles 129, 1° and 130; having regard to the Act of 22 April 1999 on accounting and tax professions; having regard to the opinion of the High Council for the economic professions, given on 14 May 2020; having regard to the Opinion of the Council of State, given on 8 July 2020, pursuant to Article 84 (1), first paragraph, 2°, of the Laws of the Council of State, coordinated on 12 January 1973; whereas Article 61, third paragraph, of the Law of 17 March 2019 relating to the professions of accountants and tax advisors (hereinafter the Law of 17 March 2019) provides that the Institute of Tax Advisors and the Accountants (hereinafter the Institute) shall take into account the rights and obligations of the two merging Instituts, in particular the Institute of the Accountants and the Professional Institute of Erkening Accountants and Fiscalists; whereas the Act of 17 March 2019 provides that theWhereas, in response to the opinions of the Council of State and of the High Council for the economic professions, the intern auditor or the intern tax consultant who is internship under the supervision of the Institute of Accountants and the Tax Consultants and its organs, the internship after the date of entry into force of the Law of 17 March 2019 shall continue at the Institute, while maintaining all the results and exemptions obtained by the intern and in accordance with the conditions and detailed rules laid down in Law of 17 March 2019 and its implementing decisions; whereas, in response to the opinions of the Board of State and the Boards of Appeal, the results and exemptions from the entrance examination to the internship of the auditor or tax consultant shall continue after the date of entry into force of the Law of 17 March 2019; whereas the Institute shall provide the necessary means for the performance of the tasks of those organs; whereas, in response to the opinions of the Board of State and the Board of Appeals of the Financial Boards and the Board of Appeals of 17 March 2019, theWhereas, in response to the opinions of the Council of State and of the High Council for Economic Activities of 17 March 2019, the mandate of the BIBF as referred to in Article 44 (1) of the Law of 22 April 1999 on accounting and fiscal professions shall continue after the date of entry into force of the Law of 17 March 2019 under the supervision of the Institute and its organs; whereas the disciplinary files shall be submitted to the disciplinary bodies of the two merging Instituts shall continue to be dealt with by the respective disciplinary bodies of the two merging Instituts, as provided for in Article 122 of the Law of 17 March 2019; whereas the Institute shall provide the necessary means for the performance of the tasks of those disciplinary bodies; whereas, in response to the opinions of the Council of State and of the High Council for Economic Affairs, the supervisory files made by the Institute of the Accountants and the Tax Officers pursuant to Article 122 of the Law of 17 March 2019; whereas, the Institute shall provide the necessary means for the exercise of the tasks of those disciplinary bodies;Data in Brussels, 11 September 2020.
