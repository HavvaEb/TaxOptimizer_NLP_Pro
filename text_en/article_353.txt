In accordance with Article 84, paragraph 3, first paragraph, of the draft Royal Decree in the first place at the first place at the Council of State, the Law has had to restrict itself to examining the power of the author of the act, the legal basis or the formal requirements to be fulfilled.Advocate General F.G. Jacobs delivered his Opinion at the sitting of the Full Court on 11 March 2002.The Committee considers that, in view of the acute nature of the situation and the seriousness of the socio-economic impact which it has created, it is appropriate, after that first stage, to concentrate more on the self-employed who are most affected by the crisis, but it is important that the aid provided for by the temporary extension of the transitional right should be directed at all self-employed persons who, as a result of the restrictive measures relating to COOVID-19, need financial support in order to achieve a serious income reduction.On the basis of the available figures and the findings of the practice, the Committee considers that it is necessary, in the light of both the legitimacy of the system and the legitimacy of the system (cf. infra), to make the exercise in its assessment, inter alia on the basis of the available figures and the findings of the practice.It is indeed correct that from 31/8 onwards these self-employed can no longer rely on the crisis bridging right 4bis § 1. More than any self-employed who are not covered by the bridging right to support the restart and also not under the crisis bridging right Art 4bis § 2 will no longer be able to benefit from the replacement allowance. Under the crisis bridging right also up to 31/8 self-employed persons who must be quarantined after a high risk contact in so far as the quarantine lasts for at least 7 days. Thus, this part is not renewed. Thus, it can be argued that someone covered by the MB is always legally forced to interrupt, while those covered by Article 4bis § 1 are effectively and economically forced by the crisis to interrupt for at least 7 consecutive calendar days per month and from 1 July 2020 onwards, they must demonstrate the effective relationship between the interruption on the one hand and the COVID-19 crisis on the other hand, on the basis of objective elements which indicate that the pandemic effect of the economy and its crippling effect on a part of the economy, still make it impossible to start the activity fully (with which are not eligible under the scheme).The Council of State's decision of 23 March on the suspension of the right to bridge provided for in Article 4a (1) of the Law of 23 March 2020, to decide in a final manner whether such cessation is compatible with Articles 10, 11 and 23 of the Constitution. Furthermore, the Law is aware that the King's power to do so is limited or not to extend the aforementioned legal provisions and that any substantive adjustment of the regime of the bridging right, which is also included in the opinion of the General Management of the Social Status of the Self-employed, is a matter for the legislator. In any case, it is highly advisable that the authors of the draft decision should draw up and include in the light of these constitutional provisions in the decision to be taken by the King.Article 23 allows the municipalities and the authorities of the administrative police to take additional preventive measures in accordance with Article 4 (2) and to that effect the preventive measures may also be applied to the markets and fairgrounds which are also subject to the approval of the municipal authorities (but on the basis of Article 9 MB 30/6/2020). Let us take the example of the activities referred to in Article 4a, § 2 of the Act of 23 March 2020 and the Ministerial Decree of 30 June 2020 'contains urgent measures to restrict the distribution of the coronavirus COVID-19'.On 30 June 2020 (see paragraph 1 of Article 7 of the Act of 27 March 2020) 'which authorizes the King to take measures to combat the spread of Covid-19 (II) Covid). (5) By Royal Decree No 41 of 26 June 2020 'to amend the Law of 23 March 2020 amending the Law of 22 December 2016 introducing a transitional right for self-employed persons and introducing temporary measures under Covid-19 in favour of self-employed persons' (6) Unlike the position of the Finance inspector in its opinion of 17 July 2020, point 2.2.1. (7) All of this, of course, subject to a timely ratification of Royal Decree No 41 of 26 June 2020 (8) GwH 17 March 2016, No 42/2016, B.13. (9) GwH 31 May 2018, No 62/2018, B.8.3; GwH 8 May 2019, No 64/2019, B.7.2; GwH 5 December 2019, No 19.2.Status of the Self-employed (p. 7): "Also the question arises as to how far the link with the MB as it applied until 3 May will remain sustainable in the coming months. Among other things, when municipal, urban, provincial or regional authorities may impose new restrictive and/or closure measures on their territory, independently of the federal MB." (16) This Ministerial Decision replaced the Ministerial Decision of 23 March 2020 on "emergency measures to restrict the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19," referred to in the above mentioned legal provision.
