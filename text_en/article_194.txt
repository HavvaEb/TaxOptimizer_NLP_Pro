The draft was examined by the General Assembly on 22 April 2021. The general meeting was composed of Jacques JAUMOTTE, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the European Union of the European Union and of the Council of Europe on 23 April 2021. On 16 April 2021, the Council of State, Department of Legislation, requested by the Minister of Internal Affairs, Institutional Reforms and Democratic Renewal to provide an opinion on a draft Ministerial Decision of 28 October 2020 on urgent measures to restrict the dissemination of the coronavirus COVID-19 within a period of five working days, extended to eight working days;*) an opinion on a draft Ministerial Decision amending the Ministerial Decision of 28 October 2020 on urgent measures to restrict the dissemination of the coronavirus COVID-19. The draft was examined by the General Assembly on 22 April 2021. The general meeting was composed of Jacques JAUMOTTE, Chairman of the Council of State of the European Union of the European Union on 23 April 2021.Article 5 (2) of the Ministerial Decision of 28 October 2020 is extended to 31 May 2021 (Article 7 of the draft). 1.2. The amendments to the so-called corona measures may be summarised as follows. The rule contained in Article 5 (2) of the Ministerial Decision of 28 October 2020 is replaced in principle by the rule that a consumer may be accompanied in principle by one person of the same household (Article 1 of the draft).The pilot projects which are organized on the basis of the protocol to be determined by the competent ministers and the Federal Minister of Health on the basis of a framework, calendar and roadmap for the organisation of pilot and pilot projects, both within and outside, in accordance with the decision of the Consultative Committee on the matter" (Article 8 of the draft - new second paragraph of Article 29 of the Ministerial Decision of 28 October 2020). In addition, some amendments of a rather technical nature are made.On Monday, 26 April 2021, the General Assembly considered it appropriate to give this opinion without waiting until the last day of the period in question, and on the contrary, to give the opinion within the initial five working days period. In those circumstances, the General Assembly of the Legislation Division of the Council of State wishes to draw attention to the fact that, within the prescribed five working days for the examination of the request for advice and the giving of the opinion, the examination which it has carried out in this way is strictly limited to the amending provisions submitted to it, as well as to the specified period of application of the Ministerial Decision of 28 October 2020, in so far as that period relates to the amendments made to the Ministerial Decision in question, and thus does not include the full decision, as extended by Article 7 of the draft law, A. RIGROND 4.Article 4 of the Law of 31 December 1963 on Civil Protection provides: 'The Minister to whom internal affairs belong, organizes the means and draws the measures necessary for civil protection for the whole of the territory of the country; he coordinates the preparation and application of such measures both in the various ministerial departments and in the public bodies; that coordination shall also cover all measures relating to the use of the resources of the Nation, which must be taken in peacetime with a view to civil protection in the period of war. The Minister shall exercise his power in respect of matters relating to civil protection which are dealt with in international organizations, and following the relevant international exchanges in that territory.'Article 181 of the Act of 15 May 2007 relating to civil security' shall be as follows: "Art. 181. § 1. The Minister or his delegate may, in the case of interventions under the contracts referred to in Article 11, in the absence of available public services and in the absence of sufficient resources, recover the persons and cases he considers necessary. The same power shall be conferred on the Mayor and the Zone Commander and, in the case of delegation of the latter, to the officers during the interventions of those departments in the context of their missions.In addition, the Minister or, where appropriate, the mayor or the zone commander, may of his own motion carry out the said measures, at the expense of the renegade or in default persons.' Article 11 of the Law of 15 May 2007, referred to in Article 181 (1) of the same law, the various general tasks of the operational services of civil security shall be listed as follows: "paragraph 1. (...): 1° the rescue and assistance to persons in threatening circumstances and the protection of their goods; 2° the urgent medical assistance provided for in Article 1 of the Law of 8 July 1964 on urgent medical assistance; 3° the fight against fire and explosion and their consequences; 4° the release of dangerous substances by means of dangerous substances and ionizing radiation;The Court of First Instance held that, in a decision of 31 March 2021, the French court of first instance of Brussels decided that the ministerial decisions of 18 and 28 October 2020 did not have an adequate legal basis.(Article 3 of the Law of 15 May 2007 provides for all civil measures and means necessary for the performance of the tasks provided for in the Law of 15 May 2007 (Article 3 in conjunction with Article 1, paragraph 2, 7°, of the Law of 15 May 2007). In the event of imminent circumstances, the Minister or his authorised population may, in order to ensure its protection, undertake to remove from places or areas which are particularly exposed, threatened or affected, and those which are subject to such measures a provisional residence; for the same reason, he may prohibit any movement or movement of the population' (Article 182 of the Law of 15 May 2007).Article 3, 1° of the Law of 5 August 1992 shall mean any legal or material enforceable act of administrative or judicial police which constitutes, for the benefit of citizens, an indication, obligation or prohibition'. It shall be established that, pursuant to Article 135 (2), second paragraph, 5°, of the New Community Law, it is the responsibility of the municipalities to provide, for the benefit of the inhabitants, for a good police, in particular as regards health, safety and rest on public roads and public buildings. In particular, the following matter of police shall be entrusted to the vigilance and authority of the municipalities, to take appropriate measures to prevent disasters and plagues, such as fire, epidemics and epizootics, and to provide the necessary assistance to stop them'.In October 2020, the General Meeting of the Administrative Judgment Division, also in the context of an action for suspension in the event of an urgent need, considered that a plea alleging that the Minister, also in the light of the principle of legality in criminal matters laid down in Article 14 of the Constitution, had exceeded its powers by establishing a temporary curfew was not serious.Article 8 of the draft Regulation provides for the possibility to derogate, under certain conditions, from the rules contained in the ministerial decision of 28 October 2020 in the framework of pilot projects. In so far as the rules which may be based on the terms of the proposed provision may be found in the legal basis for the provisions in question, Article 6 of the draft decision of 28 October 2020 shall also provide legal basis for Article 8 of the draft decision of 28 October 2020 in so far as the derogation (or may have) to other parts of the ministerial decision of 28 October 2020 in so far as it is based on the rules which may also provide a legal basis for the provisions in question.However, the Minister responsible for Economic Affairs (and not the Minister responsible for Internal Affairs) authorized to appoint officials for the purposes of "the investigation and determination of infringements of the provisions of this Code, of its implementing acts and of the regulations of the European Union for which this book provides for sanctions, with the exception of the provisions contained in Book IV and its implementing decisions'. Also, the provisions on the special powers of those officials in Articles XV.10/1 and the following of the Code of Economic Law do not contain any possibility for them to be empowered to detect and adopt provisions of the Ministerial Decision of 28 October 2020. However, in accordance with Article XV.10 of the Code of Economic Law, the King may not, by a decision adopted in the Council of Ministers, grant to the aforementioned officials additional specific powers to detect and determine infringements, provided that that the royal decision is confirmed by law within 18 months of its entry into force. However, such possibility cannot be used in the draft ministerial decision, unless a royal decision is first developed to implement the latter act.In the fight against an epidemic emergency, the federal government may take measures within the framework of its powers of: - health policy; - maintenance of public order, more specifically the maintenance of public health (sanitary police); - civil protection and civil security; - control of external borders; - sanitary measures within the framework of other federal powers. In this case, various measures designed to relax the present draft fall within the scope of the federal powers of sanitary police, civil protection and/or civil security. In the past, the general meeting of the Legislative Department in its Opinion 68.936/AV has stated that, in the past, in the fight against an epidemic emergency measure such as the closure of educational institutions, the prohibition of cultural events or civil security, the federal government has only adopted measures in favour of a policy area which falls within the competence of the communities and/or the regions.It is not for the Council of State, in the light of the nature of the facts on which it supports, to demonstrate the seriousness of those facts and of the circumstances of the case that the measure it is considering is a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure: in particular, it is for the Federal Government to ensure that there is a sufficiently direct and close link between, on the one hand, the conduct and circumstances of the case and, on the other hand, the disturbance of the public order which it is intended to avoid in such a way that the measure is justified.'(20) A second condition is that the Federal Government, which is in favour of taking a measure directly affecting the interests of the Länder, must take into account in advance the circumstances of the case and, on the other hand, the distortion of the public policy which it is intended to impose in such a way that it is not capable of acting in such a manner as to justify its discretion.It is not for the Federal Government, in the context of combating an epidemic emergency on the basis of the powers of administrative police, civil protection and/or civil security, to take measures without a sanitary dimension. For example, the Federal Government may impose an oral mask obligation and a social distance requirement in schools and museums, in so far as that is a proportionate and necessary measure (rand number 33), and - in extreme circumstances - even decide to close them. However, it cannot impose alternative educational and cultural arrangements on the communities, such as the obligation to offer distance learning or to provide an on-line Museum offer, or vice versa, to exclude them. Such measures cannot be regarded as sanitary measures" 15. In this case, the examination of the three above-mentioned requirements leads to the following observations: - as regards the requirement of material proportionality, it is apparent from the preamble of the present draft decision that it was preceded by an analysis of the recent scientific data.It is not possible, however, for the Federal Government to cooperate with that organization, specifically from the point of view of its powers, under which it may grant exemption from the measures contained in the Ministerial Decision of 28 October 2020 and in the form of a provisional decision of the Board of Appeal, to the extent that it is not possible, in accordance with Article 8 (4), first paragraph, 4°, of the Ministerial Decision (Article 2 of the Draft Decision), to determine the legal scope of the latter "decision', the delegate replied as follows: "This addition must ensure that the protocols are drawn up on the basis of the decisions taken by the Consultative Committee of 5 February 2021, where the specific modalities for the reopening of the contact professions were explicitly explained, and the Consultation Committee of 19 March 2021 and 14 April 2021, where the possibility of organising pilot and pilot projects for which the communities or the regions are competent'."Les parties requérantes ne contestent pas que l'arrêté ministériel attaqué poursuit un objectif de santé publique et qu'il s'agit là d'un objectif légitime. Ainsi que le relève le préambule de l'arrêté attaqué, la pressure sur les hôpitaux et sur la continuité des soins non COVID-19 demeure élevée, le risque pour la santé publique persiste et des compromise doivent être faits.

En ce sens, toutes les mesures prévues par l'arrêté ministériël du 28 octobre 2020, tel que modifié notamment par l'arrêté ministériel attaqué, forment un tout indivisible et indissociable. L'arrêté ministériël attaqué participate clairement à la stratégié de la partie adverse fondée sur un équilibre permanent à trouver entre, d'une part la prévention de nouvelles contaminations, la protection du fonnementnement des hôpitaux et du secteur de la santé, et d'auté part, la sauvegarde de la bel'térne à la bel'Nouveau d'équilibre tenant compte de l'évolution de la situation sanitaire et notomment de l'évolution du nombre d'infections, des hospitalisations, du taux de positivité et du taux de reproduction afin de continuer à limiter la propagation du virus et que si l'arrêté attaqué prévoit quelques sossouplissements progressifs notomment pour les professiones de contact non médicales ou les activités extériéures, il impose et mainient encore de nombres autres restrictions afin d'attindre cet équilibre.

In particular the possibility contained in the draft Article 29, second paragraph, of the Ministerial Decision of 28 October 2020 to depart from the provisions of the Ministerial Decision of pilot and pilot projects in the same way shows that there is a regulatory value of these protocols. Also elsewhere, the authorised representative states that "the Economic Inspection shall monitor compliance with the measures resulting from the MB (and, where appropriate, from the actual measures resulting from the sector protocols)'. Finally, it should also be noted that the definition in Article 8 (4), first paragraph, 2°, 3° and 4°, and second paragraph, 2° (Article 2 of the draft) of the Decision of 28 October 2020 should apply to certain exceptions to the prohibition of certain performances of services provided for by "the applicable protocol' and that the definition itself of the Protocol in Article 1, 3°, of the Ministerial Decision of 28 October 2020 should not be interpreted by theIf the adult companion can be added to the companion of the same household or by a sustained close contact, this should be clarified in the operative part of the proposed provision. 23.2. More generally, the question arises as to how the relaxation provided for in Article 1, 2° of the draft relates to other provisions of the Ministerial Decision to be amended. Thus, Article 13 (2) of that Decision with regard to markets that are "sold individually and during a period of maximum 30 minutes" is replaced by the following: "This is a legitimate objection. This discrepancy is not possible. We propose that the following additional article be added to the draft: Article 13 of the same Decision shall be replaced by the following paragraph: "The visitors shall be admitted to a maximum 30 minutes."The Hoofdgriffier, Gregory Delannay The President of the Council of State, Jacques Jaumotte ________ Notas (*) This extension is the result of Article 84 (1), first paragraph, 3°, of the laws of the Council of State, coordinated on 12 January 1973, which provides that the five working days period shall be extended to eight working days in the case where the opinion is given by the general meeting applying Article 85 (1) To date, no request for an opinion has been submitted to the Legislative Department in connection with the various ministerial decisions already adopted by the General Assembly pursuant to Article 85 (1) to date.Les poursuites exercées par le Ministère public sur la base de cet arrêté doivent, partant, être déclarées recevables.
