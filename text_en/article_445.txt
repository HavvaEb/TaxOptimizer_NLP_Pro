The Flemish Government's decision to amend the Flemish Government's decision of 15 May 2020 to regulate certain temporary measures relating to subsidies in the sports policy field due to the civil emergency in relation to public health under the Coronavirus COVID-19, as regards grants 2021 Legal basis This decision is based on: - the Decree of 20 March 2020 on measures in the event of a civil emergency in relation to public health, Article 5. Formal requirements The following formal requirements are fulfilled: - The Treasury has given its opinion on 27 April 2021. - No opinion has been requested from the Council of State, applying Article 3 (1) of the Laws on the Council of State, coordinated on 12 January 1973. The measures taken by the National Security Council regarding the coronacrisis and the resulting measures of the federal coronavirus measures must be dealt with as quickly as possible. In addition, it is of fundamental importance that beneficiaries of a grant also for 2021 be clarified as quickly as possible about their subsidies and on the corresponding administrative obligations.The Flemish Government therefore approved on 15 May 2020 the decision to regulate certain temporary measures relating to subsidies in the sports policy field due to the civil emergency in relation to public health under the coronavirus COVID-19. Since the pandemic continues, some of the temporary measures should also be continued in 2021. - It is fair to continue in 2021 the costs incurred by beneficiaries of a subsidy within the sport policy field for activities or events that have not, have been adapted, or have been limited due to the civil emergency situation under the coronavirus COVID-19, to be paid out within the limits of the grant granted and taking into account the grant conditions. Thus, as far as possible, it is avoided for the beneficiaries of a grant to make permanent use of the financial problems. It concerns payments that are already foreseen and therefore no longer generate additional costs for the Flemish government. - The Law of 20 December 2020 contains several temporary and structural provisions on justice in the context of the fight against the distribution of the coronavirus COVID-19 allows for permanent use of the general meeting of the distance.- The umbrella student sport organisation of the Flemish universities and colleges, and the recognition and subsidy of a Flemish umbrella student sport organisation, should spend a minimum of 10% of the subsidy on the concrete organisation of cross-student sport initiatives and the participation of students in international student sport initiatives each year. Due to the coronapandaemia and the corona measures, certain cross-student sport initiatives and international student sport initiatives cannot be organized as a result of the measures taken in the context of the corona crisis. Therefore, the Flemish Community Commission and the organisation for the supervision of local authorities which are subsidised by the Decree of 6 July 2012 on the promotion and subsidising of a local sports policy cannot comply with certain decremental conditions in the context of the corona crisis.on the promotion and subsidising of a local sports policy; - the Decree of 8 November 2013 on the promotion, coordination and subsidising of employment in the sport sector; - the Decree of 10 June 2016 on the recognition and subsidising of the organised sport sector; - the Decree of 5 May 2017 on the support of upper-local sports infrastructure and top-sport infrastructure; - the decision of the Flemish Government of 20 December 2013 on the implementation of the Decree of 8 November 2013 on the promotion, coordination and subsidising of employment in the sport sector; - the decision of the Flemish Government of 16 November 2012 on the implementation of the Decree of 6 July 2012 on the promotion and subsidising of a local sports policy; - the decision of the Flemish Government of 16 September 2016 establishing the general conditions of recognition and subsidy for the organised sport sector; - the decision of the Flemish Government of 27 January 2017 on the implementation of the Decree of 10 June 2016 on the recognition and subsidisation of the organised sport sector on the conditions for obtaining a subsidy for the implementation of the top-sport policy.In Article 12 of the same Decision, the following shall be added between the year "2020" and the phrase "for the year "for the year "for the year "for the year "for the year "for the year "for the year "for the year "for the year "for the year "for the year "for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the period " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " for the year " forthe Flemish Government, J.
