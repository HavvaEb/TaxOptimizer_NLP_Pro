Royal Decree amending certain measures relating to driving licences following the COVID-19 crisis FILIP, King of Belgium, to all who are now and will be listed below, Our Greeting. Having regard to the law on police on road traffic, coordinated on 16 March 1968, Article 21, replaced by the law of 9 July 1976 and amended by the law of 18 July 1990, Article 26 replaced by the law of 9 July 1976 and Article 46, replaced by the law of 18 July 1990; having regard to Regulation (EU) 2020/698 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 2020 laying down specific and temporary measures following the COOVID-19 outbreak in connection with the renewal or renewal of certain certificates, certificates and licences, and the postponement of certain periodic inspections and training in certain areas of transport legislation; having regard to the Royal Decree of 23 March 1998 concerning driving licences; having regard to the Royal Decree of 4 May 2007 on driving licences, the professional and continuing training of drivers of vehicles and categories C1, C1+E, D1+E, D1+EWhereas, in addition to its application after 31 August 2020, in the current state of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Belgian regime is thus more favourable than the Belgian regime for all holders of a driving licence, the categories listed therein and the Union codes 95 in the period after 31 January 2020, until 31 August 2020; whereas, moreover, in the present state of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is not likely to be more favourable than for all holders of a driving licence, the categories listed therein and the Union codes 95 in the period after 31 January 2020 and until 31 August 2020; whereas, in addition, in the present state of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in the current state of the present State, in the present case of the licences, the categories indicated therein and in the periods beyond 31 January 2020 and in the period from 1 August 2020 to 31 March 2020, theWhereas the exemption from driving licences for holders of European driving licences in Belgium is no longer necessary, since the European Regulation concerns all European driving licences and thus solves the problem in a manner more consistent with the Belgian objectives in the field of road safety; whereas the legal certainty affected by the publication of the subsequent European regulation must be restored as a matter of urgency and the clarity of the rules to be complied with in respect of the driving licence, the category mentioned therein, and the Union Code 95 is absolutely necessary for road safety in Belgium; whereas the entry into force of the European Regulation with retroactive effect requires an ab initio modification of the Belgian rules in force; whereas the Flemish Ministerial Decision of 24 March 2020 on mobility and public works, which provides for provisional driving licences issued between 16 March and 30 December 2020 provides for the possibility of carrying out the practical examination of 31 December 2020; whereas it creates a period of three months during which certain holders of provisional driving licences are no longer permitted to continue to operate in accordance with the- 392 from 4 May to 16 May; - 897 from 18 May to 13 June; Whereas municipal authorities are likely to face an influx of citizens during the summer holidays (when their staff may be understaffed) and especially during the month of September, for citizens a heavy administrative month, there is a good chance that they will be confronted with an influx of citizens; Whereas the change of the automatic extension from 30 September to 31 December makes it possible to distribute cases of "delay" better and the presence curve in the offices of the municipal authorities where the holders of the provisional driving licences in question will go after they have completed their exams over a longer period of three months and thus can be better spread over time, so that the situation is normal again by 2021 and that there will be no situation in which too many citizens at the same time must visit municipal services (and examination centres) which would indirectly prevent them from maintaining the physical distance necessary to combat the SARS-CoV-2-virus; Whereas the Federal State's date is binding everywhere in Belgium;(a) the phrase "by way of derogation from this Decision and from the Royal Decree of 10 July 2006 on driving licences for vehicles of category B" shall be replaced by the phrase "by way of derogation from this Decision and from the Royal Decree of 10 July 2006 on driving licences for vehicles of category B" shall automatically be replaced by the phrase "by way of derogation from this Decision and from the Royal Decree of 10 July 2006 on driving licences for vehicles of category B."for road traffic is responsible for the implementation of this Decision.
