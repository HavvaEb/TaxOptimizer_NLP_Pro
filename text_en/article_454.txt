This reform results from the transposition into Belgian law of Part 2 of the Council Directive (EU) 2017/2455 of 5 December 2017 amending Directive 2006/112/EC and Directive 2009/132/EC as regards certain VAT obligations for services and distance selling of goods (hereinafter "the Directive of 20 December 2019") to the Council of 21 November 1995.Council Regulation (EU) No 282/2011 of 15 March 2011 laying down measures for the implementation of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) and Council Regulation (EU) No 282/2011 of 21 November 2019 amending Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011 as regards supplies of goods or services facilitated by electronic interfaces and special arrangements for taxable persons who provide services to non-taxable persons, distance sales of goods and certain domestic goods (hereinafter "the Implementing Regulation 2019/2026'), as amended, as regards the date of entry into force, by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1112 of 20 July 2020 amending Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2026 as regards the dates of application in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Implementing Regulation contains a number of important clarifications as regards the correct application of the rules contained in Part 2 of Directive 2017/25 and in Council Directive 2019/1995;The Commission considers that, in view of the above considerations, it is necessary to examine whether the measure in question constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty and whether it constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.The measures implementing the provisions of the Law of 2 April 2021 and included in this draft are further explained below. This draft takes into account the comments of the Law of the Council of State in its Opinion No 69.432/2 of 21 June 2021, with the exception of point 6 (see comment on Article 19 of the draft). Article 1 This draft Royal Decree provides, on the one hand, for the transposition of Part 2 of Directive 2017/2455 and, on the other hand, for the transposition of Directive 2019/1995. Member States were originally required to take the legal and administrative measures necessary to comply with the abovementioned Directives with effect from 1 January 2021. However, pursuant to Council Decision (EU) 2020/1109 of 20 July 2020 amending Directives (EU) 2017/2455 and (EU) 2019/1995 as regards the dates of transposition and application in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, that date was postponed until 1 July 2021. Finally, this Royal Decision provides for the rules which, by the partial transposition of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 concerning the common tax on the basis of Article 2 of Article 1 of Article 1 of the Treaty.by the supplier or for his account to another Member State in respect of a taxable person or a non-taxable legal person who is not required to pay the tax in respect of his intra-Community acquisitions of goods or for any other non-taxable person; that obligation shall, at any time, require the taxable person concerned to be able, for the benefit of officials of the administration charged with the value added tax, to determine, for the current calendar year, the total amount of their supplies of goods eligible for the calculation of the thresholds referred to in Article 15, paragraph 1, paragraph 1, 1°, (for deliveries made to Belgium) and paragraph 2, 2°, of the Code of Conduct (for deliveries made from Belgium to another Member State); that obligation shall apply only where those supplies are deemed to be made in the Member State of commencement of dispatch or transport, which, on the one hand, does not imply that the above threshold has been exceeded in the current calendar year nor in the preceding calendar year and, on the other hand, that the taxable person has not chosen to charge such supplies in the Member State of arrival of the goods or carriage of the goods in question.In order to comply with the abovementioned threshold, Article 16 (1) of the Royal Decree No 1 retains the obligation for taxable persons established in Belgium who carry out intra-Community distance sales of goods which are considered to be in Belgium pursuant to Article 15 (2), second paragraph, new, of the Code, to be subject at any time to the tax on added value, for the current calendar year, to determine the total amount of their intra-Community distance sales of goods.Article 58c, new, of the Code relates to the special EU regime, the scope of which is extended to all services supplied to non-taxable persons and which, pursuant to Article 21a of the Code, are considered to be carried out in a Member State other than that in which the provider is established, irrespective of the point of reference of the localisation rule.The scheme also covers other categories of transactions (in this case intra-Community distance sales of goods and even certain domestic supplies of goods), depending on the circumstances in which those transactions are carried out.The substantive scope of these two schemes will therefore no longer be limited to the strict category of services of TBE services which are not taxable on condition that those taxable persons are established in the Member State in which the VAT system is applied.The scope of Article 58c of the Code has also been extended to include:The first paragraph of Article 18 (7) of the Royal Decree No 1 which lays down the formalities to be taken into account for the declaration of the transactions in respect of which the taxable person makes use of these schemes must be completed on a quarterly basis, in accordance with Articles 58ter, 6 and 58c, § 6 of the Code, and on a monthly basis for the import arrangements in accordance with Article 58quinquies, § 6 of the Code.Article 26a, § 1, new, of Royal Decree No 1, therefore refers to the accounts to be held for VAT purposes by taxable persons using the special schemes referred to in Articles 58ter and 58c of the Code, excluding taxable persons referred to in Article 54ter of the Code. The obligation to keep such accounts is provided for in Articles 58ter, § 7 and 58c of the Code, respectively. These accounts shall be carried out by the taxable persons concerned in the form of a register of transactions covered by those special schemes. The register shall be sufficiently detailed to permit the tax administration of the Member State of consumption to determine the accuracy of the VAT return referred to in Articles 58ter, 6 and 58c of the Code.Article 26a, Paragraph 2, new, of Royal Decree No 1 concerns the accounts to be kept by taxable persons using the special scheme referred to in Article 58quinquies of the Code, excluding the taxable persons referred to in Article 54ter of the Code. The obligation to keep such accounts is provided for in Article 58quinquies, Paragraph 7 of the Code. Such accounts shall be made by the taxable person or by the intermediary within the meaning of Article 58quinquies, paragraph 2, of the Code for each of the taxable persons represented in the form of a register of transactions carried out within the framework of this special scheme which is sufficiently detailed for the purposes of the tax administration of the Member State of consumption in question.Article 26a (3) of Royal Decree No 1 concerns, finally, the accounts to be carried out by persons using the special scheme provided for in Article 58s of the Code. It concerns the persons applying to the general administration of customs and excise duties in Belgium for the account of the person for whom the goods are intended. Article 26a (3) of the Royal Decree No 1 concerns, finally, the accounts to be carried out by persons using the special scheme provided for in Article 58s of the Code.In that case, it is necessary, in view of the goods due and the correct application of the tax, that the tax rate applicable to all goods in the consignment shall not, in accordance with Article 5 of the Directive or the corresponding national provision or any other indication that the supply of goods or the provision of services is exempt from the tax rate, be deducted from the tax rate applicable to the goods in question in accordance with Article 5 of the Directive or the corresponding national provision or any other indication that the supply of goods or the provision of services is exempt from the tax rate applicable to the goods in question.VAT units within the meaning of Article 4 (2) of the Code) which, through the use of an electronic interface such as a market place, platform, portal or similar means, facilitate the supply of goods or the provision of services to a non-taxable person within the Community, by means of an account in the form of registers in which he incorporates such transactions. Article 54c (1) of Implementing Regulation 282/2011 provides that the taxable person referred to in Article 242a of Directive 2006/112/EC (the electronic interface which facilitates the supply of goods or the provision of services to a non-taxable person within the Community), as any taxable person who carries out supplies of goods or services himself, shall carry out the following accounts in respect of supplies where he is deemed to have itself received and supplied the goods in accordance with Article 14a of Directive 2006/112/EC or where, by his intervention, a service carried out by electronic means which is assumed to act in accordance with Article 9a of this Implementing Regulation 282/2011: - the registers referred to in Article 63c of Implementing Regulation 282/2011In the light of Article 242 of Directive 2006/112/EC, and in the interests of consistency and uniformity, Article 26ter (2) of Royal Decree No 1 provides that the taxable person referred to in Article 54ter of the Code who chooses not to use one of the special arrangements of the OSS system shall also be obliged to include in the registers referred to in Article 54ter of the Code the same information as the person to be included if he would make use of one of the simplification schemes referred to in Articles 58ter to 58quinquies of the Code.of that provision (and referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 26ter, new, of Royal Decree No 1), Article 26ter, paragraph 3, new, of Royal Decree No 1, therefore refers to the accounts to be kept for VAT purposes by the taxable person referred to in Article 54ter of the Code in respect of other acts referred to in Article 26ter, §§ 1 and 2, new, of Royal Decree No 1. This includes, inter alia, the supplies for which he is not deemed to have received and delivered himself in accordance with Article 13a of the Code or when he intervenes in the provision of a service by electronic means where he is not supposed to act in his own name in accordance with Article 9a of the Implementing Regulation 282/2011. The particulars to be entered in the register shall be the following, in accordance with Article 54c (2), new, of the Implementing Regulation 282/2011: - the name, postal address and electronic address or website of the supplier whose transactions are facilitated by the use of the electronic interface and, if available, the VAT identification number or national tax number of the supplier and the account number of the supplier;Article 6 (2) of Directive 86/560/EEC provides that "the refund may not be granted under more favourable conditions than those applicable to taxable persons from the Community'. This amendment shall be used to change the name of the administrative service responsible for that refund with regard to value added tax, in particular the SME Centre Specific Matters which replaces the former Central Office of Foreign Taxable Persons. Article 6 2° of the draft also makes an adjustment of the legal nature to Article 9 of Royal Decree No 4, by the deletion of paragraph 3 of that provision relating to the refund of VAT in respect of taxable persons which uses the special scheme provided for in Article 58ter of the Code. This provision is included in Article 9a of that provision.In the second case, the second paragraph of Article 9a of the Royal Decree No 4 states that, in accordance with Article 76 (2), second paragraph of the Code, the taxable person is not entitled, in principle, to deduct the tax in question from the tax in question in accordance with Article 76 (2) of the Code. In the first case, Article 9a, second paragraph of the Code, makes a distinction according to the person entitled to refund in Belgium, or is established in Belgium, but is not established in another Member State, or is not established in the Community. In the first case, Article 9a, first paragraph of Article 2 of the Royal Decree No 4 provides that the taxable person must submit an application for refund to the competent department of the administration responsible for the value added tax to which he is subject. The application must be submitted to that service in duplicate before the expiry of the third calendar year following the year in which the case of the refund.Advocate General F.G. Jacobs delivered his Opinion at the sitting of the Fifth Chamber on 18 December 2002.Article 9 Article 9 makes, on the one hand, certain terminological changes and, on the other hand, supplements Article 6 (2) of Royal Decree No 7 with a third paragraph to designate the persons who, in accordance with the possibility left by Article 201 of Directive 2006/112/EC (which provides that on importation the VAT is payable by the person designated or recognised by the Member State of importation as the person liable for payment of the tax), are considered to pay VAT on imports of goods other than products subject to excise duty (addresses of the goods imported on importation within the meaning of Article 6 (1) of Royal Decree No 7 in consignments with an intrinsic value of not more than EUR 150, carried out for a distance sale of goods imported from third countries or third countries.from third country territories or third countries imported goods where the declarant does not use the special arrangement referred to in Article 58sexies of the Code (application of the general regime on importation).Importation into Belgium of goods in consignments with an intrinsic value of more than 150 euros carried out for a distance sale in a Member State other than Belgium For consignments of such value, one of the simplification arrangements provided for in Articles 58quinquies and 58sexies of the Code for the declaration and payment of VAT, or in respect of the distance sale of goods imported from third countries or third countries, or in relation to imports, shall be subject to the tax in Belgium of goods other than excise goods in consignments with an intrinsic value of more than 150 euros for a distance sale of goods imported from third countries or third countries to which is carried out in a Member State other than Belgium.In the case of goods imported from third countries into the territory of a Member State other than Belgium, the supplier shall not be liable to pay the goods in the territory of a Member State other than that in which the goods are imported into the territory of a Member State other than that of a Member State other than that of a Member State other than that of a Member State other than that of a Member State other than that of a Member State other than that of a Member State other than that of a Member State where the goods are imported into the territory of a Member State other than that of a Member State other than that of a Member State of the European Union.Article 58sexies of the Code makes a distinction between the debtor of the import goods and the person who supplies the goods to the customs authorities. However, although the buyer of the goods is the legal debtor of the goods to which the import goods are subject, the person to whom the goods are subject, is not the person liable to pay that tax to the customs authorities.Consequently, Article 6 (2), third paragraph, 2°, new, of Royal Decree No 7 provides, in this case, that the consignee is the consignee of the imported goods and is therefore obliged to pay VAT. Since it concerns a mode of application of this special scheme, there is therefore no derogation from the rule. The place of sale at a distance of goods imported from third territories or third countries must be determined on the basis of Article 14 (2) of the Code, on the understanding that Article 15 (1), first paragraph, 2° and 3° of the Code in this case cannot apply. In the case of a supply with carriage the place of supply in accordance with Article 14 (2), first paragraph, of the Code, is therefore in principle the place where the goods are situated at the time of departure of the dispatch or transport.24 November 2015 laying down the detailed rules for the application of certain provisions of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Union Customs Code, as amended by Article 1, 9 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/893 of 29 June 2020 amending that Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447). It follows that, in the above circumstances, the importation for VAT purposes of goods entering the territory of the Community through a Member State other than that of final destination can only take place in that Member State, so that, in such a case, the Member State of importation for VAT purposes and the Member State of destination are the same, even though the goods entered the territory of the Community. (2) Failure to apply the rules referred to in Article 58sexies of the Code by the person applying the special arrangements referred to in Article 58s of the Customs and Excise for the account of the goods intended for the purposes of the ordinary VAT system of the goods when the goods are imported into the customs territory of another Member State.Article 14 (2) of the Code. In that case, the supplier will have to be identified for VAT purposes in Belgium and submit a regular VAT return in accordance with normal rules. In the absence of such a licence, the supplier will then be entitled to deduct the VAT on importation in that periodic declaration. In the absence of such a licence, the supplier shall pay the VAT payable in Belgium to the General Administration of customs and excise duties and may deduct this VAT in his periodic VAT return. In addition, he will have to include in this declaration the VAT payable on the distance sales of goods imported from third countries or from third countries.This period shall be equal to the maximum period for the payment of the customs duties due pursuant to Article 111 (6), second subparagraph, of the Customs Code.a derogation from the rules in force for the determination of the place of supply of goods with carriage in respect of intra-Community distance sales of goods, where the goods are in Belgium at the time of arrival of the dispatch or transport of the goods to the customer, to the exclusion of supplies of goods subject to the special arrangements for taxation referred to in Articles 312 to 341 of Directive 2006/112/EC (special arrangements for taxation of the profit margin).In the absence of a formal VAT Committee decision of 19 April 2021, Belgium, like almost all the other Member States, is justified by the desire for consistency in order to avoid the use of different systems for the purposes of the declaration of intra-Community distance selling of goods on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of freedom to provide services and freedom to provide services on the basis of the principle of the principle of the principle of freedom to provide services on the basis of movement of goods within the Member States.In that case, the taxable person may declare the tax on intra-Community sales of goods in Belgium and pay by way of its identification for VAT purposes in accordance with Article 53, § 1, paragraph 1, of the first indent of the first subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of Article 4 of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of Article 4 of the second subparagraph of Article 4 of the second subparagraph of Article 4 of the second subparagraph of Article 4 of the second

Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article of Article ofThis Article also does not affect the interaction between the choice to opt for the special scheme referred to in Article 58quater of the Code and the exercise of this option. This replacement is the result of the introduction of the concept of "intra-Community distance sales of goods" in Article 1, Paragraph 19 of the Code (Article 14 (4), new paragraph 1, of the Code) and the abolition of the specific national thresholds for the current system of distance sales (for distance sales to Belgium, a threshold of 35.000 euro in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 1, second paragraph, 1° of the Code) which will be replaced by the Community threshold of 10,000 euro. More specifically, Article 7, new Article 10 of Royal Decree No 10 in paragraphs 1 and 2, as regards the modalities of choice, will apply to the taxable persons concerned, depending on whether or not they make use of the special scheme referred to in Article 58quater of the Code (OSS-system) for the declaration and payment of VAT on such intra-Community distance sales of goods, which are deemed to be subject to the option in Article 1 or 2 of the principle of Article 7 of the Code.Article 7, Paragraph 1, new, of the Royal Decree No 10 states that this choice (concept) also applies to the place of supply of the TBE services in the Member State in which the recipient is established in which the recipient is resident or in which he is resident in the Member State in which he is resident.Article 21a, paragraph 2, second paragraph, (b) of the Code to determine in the Member State in which the recipient of the service is established or in which he has his place of residence or his usual place of residence. This provision shall also apply to taxable persons who wish to waive the special scheme provided for in Article 58a of the Code. In that case, the irrefutable presumption referred to in Article 7 (1) of Royal Decree No 10 shall no longer apply and, if they do not exceed the threshold of EUR 10 000, they shall, in accordance with Article 15 (2) of the Code, apply to tax on the intra-Community distance sales which they make from Belgium in the Member State of destination.Article 21a, § 2, 9°, of the Code by the Law of 2 April 2021. That provision now specifies - that the threshold of EUR 10 000 applies to the total amount, excluding VAT, of the TBE services and of the intra-Community distance sales of goods to a Member State other than that of the provider of services (Article 21a, Paragraph 2, 9°, second paragraph, c) of the Code); - that the choice provided for in that provision (to tax such TBE services in the Member State of establishment of the customer, even if that threshold has not yet been exceeded) automatically includes the option of taxing intra-Community distance sales of goods in the Member State of arrival of the goods, in accordance with Article 59c (3) of Directive 2006/112/EC (fourth paragraph of the same provision).Article 16 of the draft Regulation provides for this adjustment. This amendment of the Code also affects Article 4b of Royal Decree No 22. This provision provides for a specific obligation to invoicing to farmers who carry out distance sales of agricultural products referred to in Article 15 (2) and (3) of the Code. For these transactions, the farmer must issue to the buyer an invoice or a document valid as such which, in addition to the particulars required by the Member State in whose territory the goods are located at the time of arrival of the consignment or transport to the customer, contains a number of specific additional particulars (a serial number, the date on which the invoice or document in question is issued as such, the name and address of the buyer and the agricultural operator, the normal name and the quantity of the goods delivered and the price without tax and the other elements of the taxable amount).Article 18 Article 18 of the draft makes a legal amendment to Article 5a, second paragraph, of Royal Decree No 22 following the amendments made to this draft to Royal Decree No 4. Article 19 The conversion of Directive 2017/2455 and Directive 2019/1995 has led, inter alia, to the extension of the scope of the current MOSS system ("Mini One stop shop") to an OSS system ("One stop shop"). This extension involves an amendment of the name and details of the postal account on which the tax payments are to be made.The payment in the postal account shall always be made by the debtor by means of a transfer stating the structured communication communicated to him by the administration. Articles 22 and 23 of the draft replace respectively the heading in Subsection 4 of Section 1 and Article 13b of Royal Decree No 24. The purpose of this amendment shall be to provide a legal basis for payments (whether or not late) resulting from the submission of or corrections to MOSS declarations referred to in Article 58ter, § 5 and § 5 of the Code, such as those applicable until 30 June 2021.This procedure is essentially governed by Article 58quinquies, § 3 to 5 of the Code, whereas Article 2a of the Code, which is very similar to that referred to in Article 1 of the Royal Decree No 31, Article 26, paragraph 1 of the Code, is to be inserted in the context of the special import arrangements referred to in Article 58quinquies. This procedure, which is very similar to that applied to the liable representatives referred to in Article 1 of the Royal Decree No 31 and to the persons referred to in Article 2 of the same Decision, is to be completely digitally administered by the SME Centre.In any event, a separate basis will be established in a future draft law to cover, in a more specific manner, the recognition formalities of the intermediary within the framework of the scheme provided for in Article 58quinquies of the Code, in order to ensure greater consistency of the authorisations granted to the King within the special arrangements themselves. Article 27 The new rules thus introduced shall also apply to the intermediaries referred to in Article 58quinquies, Paragraph 3, first paragraph, of the Code. Article 3, second paragraph, of the Royal Decree No 31 provides that by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance, the solvency of the liable representative or the person previously recognized person is to be taken into account for their obligations.Paragraph 1 of the first paragraph of the first subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the first subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of Article of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second subparagraph of the second paragraph of the second subparagraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of the second paragraph of this paragraph of the second paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of this paragraph of theIn the light of the changes in the size of the undertakings given by the persons concerned, for example in the event of an increase or reduction in the tax due, or, in the case of previously recognized persons or intermediaries, in the event of a change in the number of taxable persons represented, the comparison between the taxes due shall be made in respect of the year preceding, as the case may be, the determination or modification of the security. The administration shall always carry out this review in case the amount of the security increases. On the other hand, Article 28 of the draft replaces Article 7 of the Royal Decree No 31 to take account of the various cases of VAT identification in Belgium in accordance with Article 50, paragraph 1, paragraph 3°, of the Code, as amended by the Law of 2 April 2021.(hereinafter "the Directive 86/560/EEC'), according to which the taxable person requesting reimbursement in the Member State of consumption "has not supplied supplies of goods or services the place of which is considered to be situated in the Member State of consumption', with the exception of certain specific acts. However, this was expressed in Article 7 (1) of Royal Decree No 31 in its version before 1 July 2021. However, following the amendment of Article 50 (1) first paragraph, 3° of the Code, by the Law of 2 April 2021, a distinction must be made between different cases. This is the subject of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 7 of Royal Decree No 31.

The new paragraph 2 of Article 7 of Royal Decree No 31 provides for a right of refund for any taxable person not established in the Community who is identified for VAT purposes in Belgium in accordance with Article 50 (1) first paragraph, 3°, (a) of the Code, where the taxable person not established in the Community uses the special scheme referred to in Article 58 (2) of the Code and who is also engaged in transactions covered by that scheme in Belgium.

This period shall correspond to the maximum time limit for the payment of the customs duties payable in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 111 (6) of the Customs Code of the Union. Article 369 novovicies, new paragraph 2, of Directive 2006/112/EC provides that the Member States shall require that the VAT due under this scheme is payable each month within the time limit applicable to the payment of the import duties.Article 32 of the draft Article completes paragraph 1, 2°, of Article 2 of the Royal Decree No 56 (c) to provide for a refund in cases where a taxable person not established in Belgium but established in another Member State is engaged in a taxable operation in Belgium for which he uses one of the special schemes referred to in Title XII, Section 3 or 4 of the Directive 2006/112/EC.Article 34 of the draft Regulation lays down the date of entry into force of the new provisions on 1 July 2021. By way of derogation from this general rule, the second paragraph of Article 34 of the draft Regulation provides for a deferred date of entry into force of Article 27 of the draft Regulation, which replaces Article 3 of the Royal Decree No 31 with the rules on the establishment of a guarantee in respect of liable persons and intermediaries.11 February 2019, Article 52, paragraph 1, replace by the Law of 28 December 1992 and amended by the Royal Decree of 22 December 1995, confirmed by the Law of 15 October 1998, Article 54b, paragraph 4, inserted by the Law of 2 April 2021, Article 55 § 3, replaced by the Law of 7 March 2002 and amended by the Law of 20 December 2002, Article 57 § 5, second paragraph, inserted by the Law of 28 December 1992, Article 57 § 7, first paragraph, inserted by the Law of 28 December 1992, Article 58b, § 9 inserted by the Law of 2 April 2021, Article 58c, paragraph 9 inserted by the Law of 2 April 2021, Article 76 § 2, second paragraph, inserted by the Law of 26 November 2009 and Article 84, third paragraph, inserted by the Law of 4 August 1986, Article 58sexies, § 5 inserted by the Law of 2 April 2021, Article 70 § 4, first paragraph, replaced by the Law of 22 June 2012, Article 76 paragraph, paragraph, inserted by the Law of Article 84, paragraph, inserted by the Royal Decree No 1 of 29 December 1992 relating to the Law of 29 December 1992 relating to the Law of 29 December 1992 relating to the Law of 29 December 1992 relating to the Tax of 29thJanuary 1987 fixing the amount of proportional tax fines in respect of value added tax, the Royal Decree No 44 of 9 July 2012 fixing the amount of non-proportional tax fines in respect of value added tax, the Royal Decree No 56 of 9 December 2009 on the refund of value added tax to taxable persons established in a Member State other than the Member State of refund;
