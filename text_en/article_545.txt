Royal Decree No 22 establishing a compensation fund for volunteers COVID-19 victims REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, The decision of which I have the honour to submit to your Majesty for signature has the aim, on the basis of the Law of 27 March 2020 authorising the King to take measures to combat the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus (II), of taking urgent measures concerning the significant health risk to volunteers of the various associations operating on the ground and for whom the COVID-19 infection cannot currently be covered in case of death due to such contamination in the course of their voluntary activities. The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health risk to volunteers of the various associations operating on the field and for which the COVID-19 in case of death as a result of such infection in the course of their voluntary activities is currently not covered.(c) A maximum allowance for funeral expenses is also fixed for the person who has paid these costs (EUR 1020). (d) The compensation scheme applies for a limited period of time and therefore only to deaths occurring between 10 March 2020 and 1 July 2020 and to deaths occurring after this period, if the maximum compensation for funeral expenses is also fixed for the person who has paid these costs (EUR 1020).The first paragraph of Article 17a of the Act of 28 December 1944 on social security for employed persons and members of their families shall not apply to the activities referred to in Article 17 of the Royal Decree of 28 November 1969 implementing the Law of 27 June 1969 on social security for employed persons, to the extent that such activities are carried out in accordance with the provisions of Article 17a of the Law of 28 November 1969 on social security for employed persons, to the extent that they are carried out in the same way as those of Article 17a of the Act of 28 December 1969 on social security for employed persons, to the same extent as those of Article 17a of the Act of 28 December 1969 on social security for selfemployed persons, to the same extent as those of Article 17a of the Act of 28 December 1969 on social security for employed persons, to the same extent as those of Article 17a of the Act of 28 December 1969 on social security for employed persons and to the same extent as those of Article 17a of the Act of the Act of 28 December 1969 on social security for selfemployed persons.However, in accordance with the recommendation of the Council of State, the authors have re-examined the situation at this point in view of the fact that, in order to be fully consistent with the spirit of the measure - which contains provisions in favour of persons who in this period of coronavirus-related crisis continue to pursue their activities within the meaning of Article 28 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, it is necessary for the food sector to rely on such valuable reinforcements to enable the population in this period of intense crisis without too much difficulty to be supplied by the Fund.The limited period of application of the measure does not involve any voluntary activity of the Fund. Fedris may also request the organisation and/or the applicant to be documented about the sector in which the volunteer was active and about the conditions under which the volunteer carried out the activity in which he was exposed to the risk of contamination. In this way Fedris may examine to what extent the volunteer was exposed to a higher risk of infection by COOVID-19 when performing his or her activity than if he or she had strictly complied with the safety measures imposed on him or her. The examination of the file and the elements in support of the application will allow Fedris to take a reasoned decision on the basis of all these elements. The approach of Fedris to the treatment of applications under the COVID-19 will be based on the activity carried out by the volunteer during the period determined for the contagment.The Council of State considers that the link between the period of application of the draft decision and the validity of the special powers granted to the King does not appear to be appropriate, since the division of powers between the legislative and the executive power has little to do with the extent to which volunteers subject to the risk of contagion with the coronavirus. However, the Council of State also indicates that it does not have the necessary factual information to assess the date of 1 July 2020 with regard to the expiry of the draft decision.The BLOCK COUNCIL OF STATE Department of Legislation Opinion 67.319/1 of 6 May 2020 on a draft royal decree No 22 setting up a compensation fund for the volunteers COVID 19 victims. On 28 April 2020 the Council of State, Department of Legislation, was asked by the Minister of Social Affairs to give an opinion within a period of five working days on a draft royal decree No 22 establishing a compensation fund for the volunteers COVID-19 victims. The draft was examined by the First Chamber on 5 May 2020. The Chamber was composed of Marnix VAN DAMME, chairman of Chamber, Wilfried VAN VAERENBERGH and Wouter PAS, State Councils, and Wim GEURTS, Registrar. The report was issued by Jonas RIEMASACH, Auditor. The agreement between the French and the Dutch text of the opinion is subject to the supervision of Wouter PAS, State council. The text of which is given below, on 6 May 2020.7° and Article 6 (2) of the Law of 27 March 2020, as such, do not constitute a legal basis for the design, and the reference to it in the first paragraph of the introductory sentence must therefore be omitted. INQUIRY OF THE TEXTOn the terms of Article 17a of the Royal Decree of 28 November 1969 [3] (such as, inter alia, the maximum number of hours of work) it is not subject to the application of the Law of 27 June 1969. [4] Thus, activities which are much wider than the unpaid voluntary work referred to in Article 6, 1°, of the design, or the specific activities referred to in Article 6, 2°, of the design are brought under the scope of the draft decision. Although the report to the King shows that the authors of the draft view that the "very broad scope of application should not give rise to many situations, because very many sectors of activity in which volunteers usually work, have to deal with the security measures and at this time no activity is being carried out" seems to be fully consistent with the design of student labour activities, and given the validity of the measures designed for a period up to 1 July 2020 (i.e.e.e. in a period of which security measures are not known and which will not be allowed at present time), it seems to be permitted to be allowed to do so.The term "confirmation" shall be replaced by "confirmation" by "confirmation" by "confirmation" by "confirmation" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection" by "confection."The existence of such a justification must be assessed in the light of the purpose and effects of the contested measure and of the nature of the principles in question; the principle of equality and non-discrimination is infringed where it is established that there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the objective pursued.19 à cette date, et décède le 20 juillet 2020, son ayant-droit pourra être indemnisé s'il apporte la preuve que la contamination a eu lieu avant le 1 er juillet 2020. Il faut donc prouver que la contamination a eu lieu avant la fin de la période visée à l'alinéa 2. Mais cette preuve peut évidemment être apportée après la fin de la période visée à l'alinéa 2. Le texte français est le texte original. Il prévoit que l'arrêté 'est également applicable aux décès survenus apres la période visée à l'alinéa 2 si la preuve de la contamination du volontaire par le COVID-19 a été établie avant la pérét à la pérét à la pécès survenis à l'By the end of the period referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, following one of the methods provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 7 of this Article," it is recommended that the amendment of the text proposed by the authorised person be implemented.
