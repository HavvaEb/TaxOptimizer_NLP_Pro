In view of the law of 12 April 1835 on tolls and railway police regulations, Article 2; In view of the urgency which has been prompted by the need, after the meeting of the Consultative Committee of 4 March 2022, to adopt as soon as possible the measures provided for in this Decision in order to allow the continuity of the measures previously taken concerning the wearing of masks in trains after 10 March 2022, the date of the end of the application of the Pandemic Law; In view of the opinion of the Council of State, given on 10 March 2022, applying Article 84, paragraph 1, 3° of the Laws on the State, coordinated on 12 January 1973, the Expert Group on Management of COVID-19 (the GEMS) in an opinion of 28 February 2022 has been required by the Council of State to continue to ensure that the principle of mutual recognition of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of proportionality of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of proportionality of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of the principle of theOn the one hand, it is of the opinion that the prior formality of involving the regional governments in accordance with Article 6 (4) 3° of the Special Law of 8 August 1980 on the reform of the institutions has not been complied with, since the representatives of the regional governments agreed in principle at the meeting of the Consultative Committee to maintain the obligation to wear a mouth mask in public transport, but that they were not able to discuss collectively this royal act transposing this Agreement and, on the other hand, that this royal decision is unlikely to be published in the Belgian Official Journal by 11 March 2022 in order to have retroactive effect;
