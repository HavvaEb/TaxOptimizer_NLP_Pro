The urgent nature of the tax measures justifies their inclusion in this decision.The tax, the legal person tax and the non-resident tax, included in a court order which was declared enforceable between 12 March 2020 and 31 October 2020. This time limit was thus fixed to include also the reimbursements relating to financial years. Similarly, the submission of the relevant declaration forms after the date indicated on the form will not give rise to a tax increase (Article 7) or an administrative penalty (Article 8), both for late submission, provided that they are submitted by 30 April 2020. Given their one-off nature, the extensions of the retention periods or payment periods are not included in the Income Tax Code 1992 or in the other Codes or in the normal legislation. It is clear that the provisions relating to the negligence interests and the administrative penalties do not apply as the payment shall take place within the time limits thus extended.Article 11 preceeds that the taxable persons who submit monthly returns and who are already entitled to receive a refund on the basis of the tax rate applicable to them in accordance with Article 24 of Article 20 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall be exempt from the tax rate applicable to them in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.However, Article 1 of the Royal Decree of 28 January 2019 may be extended without much repercussion on the budgetary yield of those rights for a number of weeks, provided that Article 1 of the Royal Decree of 28 January 2019 provides for a period of 10 days for the presentation of judgments and judgments at the office of legal certainty.To the Vice-First Minister and Minister of Finance, A.
