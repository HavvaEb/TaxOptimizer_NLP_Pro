In a letter of formal notice of 2 July 2020 addressed to Belgium in respect of the possible incompatibility of the transposition into Belgian law of Directive (EU) 2016/1164 of 12 July 2016 laying down rules for combating tax avoidance practices which directly affect the functioning of the internal market, the Commission noted that Article 198/1, Paragraph 2, second indent, WIB 92, projects of public-private cooperation, whereas Article 4 (4) (b) of Directive 2016/1164 refers to long-term public infrastructure projects. As a result of this failure, the legislator stated that the purpose of the application of the law of 20 December 2020 concerning various tax and anti-fraud provisions, in Article 198/1 of the Code of Income Tax 1992 (WIB 92) was to replace the references to a project of public-private cooperation in a reference to a long-term public infrastructure project.The second paragraph, WIB 92, also for this second category of a delegation, is capable of ensuring that the modalities referred to in Article 73 4/10, KB/WIB 92 are in future applicable to both types of company, in no way having the effect of imposing on those taxable persons additional conditions than those laid down by law or by Directive 2016/1164; the purpose of that draft is merely to clarify the conditions which taxable persons must satisfy when providing proof that one or more loans were made in the course of a long-term public infrastructure project, whereby the operator of the project, the financing costs, the assets and the profits are all in the European Union.In addition, in the light of the above, the tax authorities will be required to assess actively the nature of the project in question in the light of the following criteria: accessibility, added value for the environment and society, the extent to which other than the investor is able to make use of it. The argument that the infrastructure project contributes to increasing the supply of employment in a given region is not decisive in the assessment of its public character.Article 73 4/8 of the Act of 20 December 2020 amending the introductory sentence of Article 198/1, paragraph 2 of the second paragraph of WIB 92, so as to clarify that the exclusion referred to in that paragraph relates not only to interest but also to the costs and revenues which are economically equivalent to interest. For the purposes of the amendments to Articles 73 4/9 and 73 4/10, KB/WIB 92 is merely to give effect to the aforementioned Act of 20 December 2020 which entered into force on 31 December 2020, these articles shall apply from the tax year 2021, irrespective of whether they are linked to that date, on or between 31 December 2020 and the date on which this Decision is published in the Belgian Official Journal 92, or on a taxable date after which a correction is to be carried out in accordance with Article 73 4/11 of the Act of 31 December 2020, pursuant to Article 92.In order to arrive at a correct and neutral result in which all intra-group transactions are cleared out, all intra-group costs and intra-group revenues must be corrected, irrespective of whether these costs or revenues are intra-group financing costs or intra-group financing revenues. Moreover, the amendments contained in Article 5 (a) and (b) of this draft aim to obtain this result. In order to ensure that the application of the provisions of Article 73 4/11, § 1, KB/WIB 92 remains neutral over the whole group, it is now explicitly provided that a company or establishment belonging to the Belgian group may only increase the EBITDA under the second paragraph, if this increase is compensated in the same way by the application of the third paragraph to another company or establishment forming part of this group.- Royal Decree implementing the law on urgent various tax and anti-fraud provisions of FILIP, King of Belgium, to all who are now and will be listed below, Our Greet.
