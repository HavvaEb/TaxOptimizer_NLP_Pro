Decision of the Brussels Capital Government No 2020/42 on the granting of a premium to the creative and cultural non-profit institutions affected by COVID-19 crisis REPORT TO THE BRUSSELS Capital Government For the attention of the members of the Government, The measures announced by the Federal Government on 18 March 2020 to limit the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus mean that the viability of cultural and creative non-profit organisations is in short term threatened by the economic and social consequences of these measures. On the other hand, while the current crisis affects the economy as a whole, the creative and cultural sector is one of the most affected sectors. On the one hand, the decision of the National Security Council to prohibit all cultural and recreational activities. On the other hand, some structures have suffered significant losses without being able to benefit from the exceptional support measures introduced by the various levels of power so far in the context of this crisis.In this context, it is not possible, for example, to claim the grant of aid by organisations which have been penalised for failure to comply with Article 10 of the Ministerial Decision of 23 March 2020 laying down the urgent measures taken to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus or have yet to be implemented by organisations which have commenced a bankruptcy or liquidation procedure or have ceased their activities. Taking into account the large number of potential beneficiaries, the procedures for applying, granting and paying the aid are based on the procedures already introduced in the framework of premiums already granted in the field of employment and economy. Finally, measures have also been taken to control and refund the aid, so that the labour inspectors of BEW can observe the compliance of this aid with the rules in force on 27 May 2020. In this way, the number of automatic checks can be maximized, which will save both the beneficiary and BEW a lot of time.Article 4a (3) of the Special Law of 12 January 1989 relating to the Brussels Institutions, which is inserted by the Special Law of 6 January 2014 relating to the Sixth State Reform, states that, without prejudice to the powers of the Flemish Community and the French Region in respect of matters of cultural policy, it is not for the Member States to take into account, in their statutes, the powers conferred on them by Article 6 (1) (a) (ii) of the Law of 8 August 1980 on the reform of the institutions as a basis for economic policy, that the Council of State may be followed, since the beneficiaries of the proposed aid scheme in their statutes must have an effective social objective which is not of an economic and commercial nature.In the light of these elements, it must therefore be stressed that the proposed aid scheme cannot ensure that its legal basis falls directly within the sphere of competence of cultural matters within the meaning of Article 4 of the special law reforming the institutions or within the meaning of Article 4a, 3°, of the special law of 12 January 1989. Contrary to what the Council of State states, it was initially not the intention of the authors to grant direct support to the "culture itself" but rather to provide support to operators in the creative and cultural sector active in the territory of the Brussels Capital Region and who have not been able to benefit from any other level of power.It is clear from the survey carried out by View.brussels that this sector would be most affected by the abolition of aid measures after June 2020. Moreover, respondents to this survey estimate that 47% of their employees who have been or will have benefited from temporary unemployment will pass on to full unemployment. Finally, almost 30% of the companies in the sector consider bankruptcy to be likely or very likely. In view of the above, there can be no question of following the advice of the Council of State, since the objective of the proposed measure is correct to grant aid to the sector most exposed to the risk of loss of employment. Thus, by acting with anticipation and preventive action, the Government aims to limit the increase in the number of job-seekers, which, as the Council of State emphasizes, is the category to which employment policy is primarily directed by means of the Brussels Capital Government: the Minister of Work, B.
