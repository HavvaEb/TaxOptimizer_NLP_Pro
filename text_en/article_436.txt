The Royal Decree amending Articles 178 and 178/1 of the Royal Decree of 27 August 1993 implementing the Code of Income Tax 1992 to amend certain provisions relating to the exemption from the obligation to make a declaration in the personal income tax REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, the Decree of which we have the honour to submit it for signature to Your Majesty for the purpose of extending the categories of taxable persons eligible to benefit from the simplified declaration procedure in the personal income tax and the abolition of another provision which has become obsolete. In accordance with Article 305 of the Code of Income Tax 1992 (WIB 92), each taxable person is required to submit annually a declaration form in the personal income tax, the model of which has been established by the King in accordance with Article 307 (1) of the WIB 92 and which is issued for that purpose by the designated service.Articles 306 and 308 WIB 92 in order to bring the law into line with administrative practice. These amendments will be carried out for the tax year 2021. Discussion of the Articles Article 1. As explained above, this provision has as an essential objective to add to the list of taxable income and other elements provided for in Article 178 § 2, KB/WIB 92 on the one hand the expenditure relating to either a tax reduction for the home in the context of a mortgage loan, or a tax reduction for the long-term savings under an individual life insurance contract or a tax reduction under a legal aid insurance contract, and, on the other hand, certain income from immovable property situated in Belgium. This change will not result in a sensitive extension of the number of taxable persons who have a proposal of simplified declaration. This change in that respect of the administrative simplification.However, the circumstances which prevent the transmission of a simplified declaration to the State in question from being sufficient to enable a majority of the taxable persons concerned to benefit from the extension of this procedure.The mortgage loans and the life insurance policies contained in the simplified declaration proposal will therefore be the classic cases relating to the integrated housing bonus, to the "Chèque Habitat', to a regional housing bonus or to a federal tax reduction for the payment of premiums for an individual life insurance policy.This draft also aims at the addition of a rate of 17° to Article 178, § 2, KB/WIB 92 so that the taxable persons who have to declare income from immovable property situated in Belgium, which must not be included in code 106 of the declaration, can also benefit from a proposal of simplified declaration.This concerns both the non-rented immovable property (Article 7, § 1, 1, 1 °, a), second indent, Wib 92) and the landlord property to natural persons who are not wholly or partially used for the exercise of their professional activity (Article 7, § 1, 2 °, second indent, Article 92) and other than those who are entitled to benefit from being entitled to a tax in respect of a tax under the condition of the State in respect of the State in respect of the State in respect of the State in question.In view of the substantial evolution of the proposal for simplified declaration in recent years, this possibility has completely lost its relevance. The current perfection of the proposal for simplified declaration results in about 90% of the proposals not being corrected by the taxable persons. If a correction proves necessary, the taxable person can always carry it out either by sending the reply form of the proposal for simplified declaration or directly via Tax-on-Web. In the latter case, the taxable person will not only have access to the electronic proposal for simplified declaration, but also to the whole of his declaration where all the information is known by the administration and which he can send to the administration.the Code of Income Tax for 1992 with a view to the amendment of certain provisions relating to the exemption from the obligation to make a declaration in the tax on persons.'The draft was examined by the Third Chamber on 31 March 2020.The Chamber was composed of Jo Baert, Chairman of the Chamber, Jeroen Van Nieuwenhove and Koen Muylle, State Councils, Jan Velaers and Bruno Peeters,assessors, and Annemie Gooossens, Registrar.The report was issued by Frédéric Vanneste, First Hearing Officer.The agreement between the French and Dutch texts of the opinion is examined under the supervision of Jo Baert, Chairman of the Chamber.The opinion, the text of which follows, is given on 14 April 2020.Application of the draft decision of the Royal Decree is intended to make two amendments to the Royal Decree of 27 August 1993 on the implementation of the Income Tax Code 1992' (hereinafter KB/WIB 92) in respect of the duty on persons' tax.On the basis of Article 306 (1), first paragraph, and second paragraph, of the WIB 92, second paragraph, of Article 306 (1), first paragraph, the King may not, in accordance with the rules and under the conditions which he lays down, by a decision adopted by the Council of Ministers, exempt categories of taxable persons from the obligation to make a declaration. Under Article 306 (2), second paragraph, the King may, in accordance with the rules and under the conditions which he lays down, determine by a decision adopted after consultation in the Council of Ministers, the cases in which the tax administration is not required to submit a proposal for a simplified declaration.In that regard, it is clear from the judgment of the Court of First Instance that, in the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court of First Instance held that, in the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court of First Instance is not in a position to determine whether the contested decision is compatible with the principle of legal certainty and to determine whether the contested decision is compatible with the internal market and whether the contested decision is compatible with the internal market and whether it is compatible with the internal market and whether it is compatible with the internal market and with the internal market and with the internal market.In order to avoid receiving a proposal of simplified declaration, taxable persons who have difficulty in collecting the necessary data and documents within that period of a month shall be able to inform the tax administration that they no longer wish to receive such a proposal in the future so that they can respond appropriately to the proposal of simplified declaration. However, the agent has indicated that in practice the tax administration is more flexible towards these taxable persons: "L'administration applique aux confibuables qui ont reçu une proposition de déclaration simplifiée les déclaration simplifiée les déclarations classiques, à savoir la fin juin pour les propositions de déclaration simplifiée paper et la mi-juillet pour les propositions de déclaration simplifiée électroniques. Comme le précise d'ailleurs leformulare de proposition de déclaration simplifiée lui-même, les contribuables pour les délais précités de déclaration simplifiée récé électiques.For the first time, Celui-ci devra modifier la proposition de déclaration simplifiée dans le délai de Tax-on-web, à savoir au plus tard à la mi-juillet, et cela pour 2 raisons. Les propositions de déclaration simplifiée sont envoyées aux citoyens qui ont un profil fiscal relation simple et stable. Une différence de traitement selon la personne qui corrige la proposition de déclaration simplifiée (le confibuable lui-même ou un mandataire) ne se justifie donc pas types de déclarations peu complexes.The Registrar, A. Goossens The President, Jo Baert _____ Nota's (1) The authorised representative provided in this context the following explanations: "L'obligation pour le contribuable de réclamer une déclaration s'il n'en a pas reçu une au 1 er juin (art. 308, § 3, CIR 92) est liée au fait que le contribuable a l'obligation d'introduire une déclaration. Le même principle ne s'applique pas à la proposition de déclaration simplifiée (PDS) puique dans ce cas, l'administration communique au controbuable les données dont elle a connaissance, celui-ci devant aurs vérifier et, si nécessaire, les corriger/compléter. En pratique, un contribique ne pas, l'controduire les pas, parqué, parcé parcé parcé.For example, Article 308 § 3 of the WIB 92 could be interpreted as follows: "The taxable amount referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be considered to have been reduced by the second indent of Article 308 of the SPF Finances, durant les séances de remplissage, pour obtenir toute l'aide nécessaire afin de vérifier leur PDS et si nécessaire la corriger. Enfin, il convient de préciser que le contribuable bénéficiant d'une PDS qui, par exemple, ne parviendrait pas à la consulter et ne ferait pas de démarches particularières auprès des services fiscaux, ne serait pas sanctionné pour déclaration tardive ou absence de déclaration dès lors que l'enrôlement serait automatiquement effectué sur base des données qui lui auront émité cass."30 APRIL 2020. - Royal Decree amending Articles 178 and 178/1 of the Royal Decree of 27 August 1993 implementing the Code of Income Tax 1992 in order to amend certain provisions relating to the exemption from the obligation to report in the personal income tax FILIP, King of Belgium, to all who are now and will be listed below, Our Greet.
