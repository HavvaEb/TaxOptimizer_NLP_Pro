Special Powers Decision of the Brussels Capital Government No 2020/020 introducing relaxing measures for registration fees in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic REPORT TO THE BRUSSELS Capital Government For the attention of the members of the Government, the WHO has qualified the coronavirus COVID-19 on 11 March 2020 as a pandemic.The health crisis caused by the COVID-19 has led to the application of large-scale national health measures, in particular the so-called "social distancing" measures decided by the National Security Council on 12 and 13 March 2020.These measures may lead to certain taxable persons being faced with unexpected additional tax burdens within the framework of registration rights.This decision aims to minimize these tax consequences by extending a number of time limits by reducing, under certain conditions, the rate of registration duty on the establishment of a mortgage.The above deadlines should also be extended at the end of the period of "social distancing" until 16 March 2020. This is the first working day following the adoption of the first measures to combat the Coronavirus contained in the Ministerial Decision of 13 March 2020 on urgent measures to restrict the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19. On the basis of the announcements of the National Security Council on 24 April and 6 May 2020 relating to the phasing-out strategy, it is also expected that the health crisis will be favourable, while certain "social distancing" measures will continue to apply progressively in May and June 2020.The Council of State's recommendation in its Opinion No 67.337/4 to take account of a fixed period rather than the abstract understanding of the end of the measures of "social distancing' has been followed up to ensure the greatest possible legal certainty and the risks of divergent interpretations of the concept of "end of the measures of social distancing'. Instead of having to change the date of the end of that fixed period (by a new special power decision), the Government is also authorized to extend to two times the current "social distancing' measures as well as the temporary cessation of a large number of economic activities provided for by the National Security Council on 24 April and 6 May 2020 in view of the unfavourable evolution of the current health crisis.The Council of State's suggestions are taken into account to the extent explained above. For information of the Brussels Capital Government, The Minister of Finance and Budget, S. GATZ COUNCIL OF STATE SECTION Legislation Opinion 67.337/4 of 7 May 2020 on a draft decision of the Brussels Capital Government No 2020/020 to introduce relaxation measures for registration rights in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic' On 30 April 2020, the Council of State, Department of Legislation, was requested by the Minister of the Brussels Capital Government, with responsibility for Finance, Budget, Public Office, the Promotion of Multilingualism and the Imago of Brussels to give an opinion on a draft decision of the Brussels Capital Government No 2020/XXX to introduce relaxing measures for registration rights in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic'. The draft was examined by the Fourth Chamber on 7 May 2020.On the basis of Article 84 (1), second paragraph, of the coordinated laws of the Council of State, the grounds of urgency specified in the request for an opinion must be taken into account in the initial part of the decision. However, in this case the legislative section, in accordance with Article 84 (3) of the said coordinated laws of the Council of State, is not expressly required to examine the legal basis of the proposal, the power of the author of the act and the prior formal requirements to be fulfilled.On 14 April 2020, on the basis of that bill, the Minister's representative's interpretation of the choice of dates included by: "Les premières mesures de confinement dateent de l'A.M. du vendredi 13 mars 2020, d'où la date retenue en ce qui concerne les procurations notaries. C'est dans les jours suivants immédiatement que'a été signalé le risque de conversion massive de mandats hypothécaires en inscriptions effectives. Ce qui menaçait d'accentue les difficultés des entreprises concernées (et le cas échéant des ménages). D'où la date retenue du 16 mars, aus pour l'article 14 et l'exemption de rétribution hypothécaire par projet d'A.Advocate General F.G. Jacobs delivered his Opinion at the sitting of the Full Court on 16 March 2020.Whereas, in view of the fact that the delay in the economic activity and the temporary unemployment of a significant number of employees is such as to weaken the financial position of many borrowers in such a way as to have an effect on the banks' ability to activate the mortgage mandates and, therefore, it is necessary to remove without delay the burden associated with a mortgage subscription for such borrowers; whereas, in view of the Council of State's opinion 67.337/4, given on 7 May 2020, pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 1, paragraph 3, 3°, of the laws on the Council of State, coordinated on 12 January 1973; whereas, in application of Article 2, paragraph 3, 5°, of the decree of 4 October 2018 introducing the equal opportunities test, it is not necessary for this test to be drawn up for a regulatory text for which the opinion of the State is requested by reason of urgency; whereas, taking into account both the need for legal certainty and the principle of equality, it is appropriate to be in accordance with Article 2 of the decree of 19 March 2020 to confer special powers on the Board of State in respect of theWhereas compliance with the time limit of 5 years referred to in Article 71 of the same Code, which is given to persons who have signed a declaration of professional qualifications in order to show a series of resellings, may be jeopardised by compliance with the time limit of 5 years referred to in Article 71 of the same Code; whereas the time limit laid down in Article 212 (1) of the same Code may be extended during the period laid down at national level to "social distancing'; whereas, in the absence of such "social distancing' measures, persons who, as a result of such "social distancing', are not in a position to conclude an authentic instrument of reselling, shall be denied the right to return for 36% of the right of registration at short notice, which they would have enjoyed without the general "social distancing' measures in respect of such goods; whereas it is essential to allow an extension of that period of that period not unduly to penalise applicants for the refund of 36% of the right of registration at short notice;Whereas the current financial context is likely to encourage the massive conversion of mortgage mandates held by the financial sector into effective mortgage bids; whereas in practice the right of one per cent to the establishment of a mortgage is due by the mortgage lender, for both natural and legal persons, and that it is appropriate to exempt him from that right on account of exceptional circumstances of economic adversity; whereas the granting of such flexibility measures in time should be limited in order to prevent abuse; whereas the Government therefore wishes, in the light of the economic urgency, to use the privileges conferred on it by the Parliament to support the citizens and companies of the Region in this difficult period;Art. 7. This decision has effect with effect from 16 March 2020. Art. 8. The Minister responsible for Finance is responsible for the implementation of this decision. Brussels, 28 May 2020.
