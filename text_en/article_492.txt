Special Powers Decision of the Brussels Capital Government No 2020/028 to introduce a premium to support tenants with limited income affected by a loss of income by the COVID-19 health crisis. - Erratum In the Belgian State Gazette of 3 June 2020, third edition, p. 40961, Act No 2020/41585, the report should be inserted to the government REPORT TO THE BRUSSELS HEAD GOVERNMENT To the attention of the members of the Government, the government decision aims to provide financial support to an important category of tenants within the Brussels Capital Region, who have been professionally affected by the global health crisis as a result of the pandemic of the coronavirus COVID-19. The World Health Organization has indeed designated the coronavirus COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 and raised the threat level of this pandemic to the highest level on 16 March 2020. Due to the number of infections and the number of deaths detected in Belgium since 13 March 2020, the federal government issued a first ministerial decision of 18 March 2020 to restrict to the COVID-19 to theAs a result of the foregoing, this decision aims to grant a unique premium to tenants on the private rental market.The conditions for this aid are mainly linked to the shown decline in the professional income of a family member as a result of the health crisis the modest family income of the tenant for the health crisis.In its general policy statement of the Brussels Capital Government and the unified college of the Joint Community Committee, the Brussels Government has confirmed the priority it attaches to the right to live.The grant of an aid grant to tenants is one of the means which allows this objective to be achieved; moreover, this is expressly provided for in the Brussels Housing Code which states in Article 166 that: "The Region may grant to the families an allowance under the conditions laid down by the Government and within the limits of the appropriations entered for this purpose on the regional budget.'The condition of a modest income is fulfilled as soon as the ceilings of net taxable income referred to in Article 6 are not exceeded by the family. These income ceilings are based on the increased admission ceilings for families provided for social housing. It is up to the candidate of the premium to show his net income for the tax years 2018 or 2019, on the basis of the latest tax bill available to him, in particular in view of any objections to the tax year 2019 which would make it impossible to fix his income for this tax year. This alternative therefore removes the difficulty for certain taxable persons to submit a tax bill for the 2019 tax year. For the tax year 2020, this is not seen as the vast majority of taxpayers cannot be concluded in time at this time of the year. The income ceilings are adjusted according to the situation of the family, and the income that this family enjoys. However, the ceilings are increased by 3.326 euro for each child to be applied to the year 2019.In the light of its experience in this matter, it is for this administration to proceed to the various procedural steps of the premium, the grant, the professions, and the penalties for proven cases of fraud which are already paid to the family, or to the person designated jointly by the tenants in accordance with Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71. In the light of its experience in this matter, it is for that administration to proceed to the various procedural steps of the premium, to the grant of the premium, to administer the charges for proven cases of fraud, to the premium paid to the family or to the person designated by the tenants in accordance with Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71.In the event that Mytax is not operating properly or that it is impossible to register itself, the applicant retains the option to use the item (Article 8 (3) and Article 9 (1) last paragraph). However, the premium granted on the basis of incorrect information and its refund may be requested upon receipt of any comments from the person concerned (Article 10). The premium paid (and not only granted) as a result of false or fraudulent practices to be attributed to the beneficiary may, in addition to the withdrawal of the premium, lead to an administrative fine of EUR 1,000 imposed on him after receipt of his defences (Article 11).The conditions governing the appeal to the implicit powers and, in particular, the condition relating to the necessity of the proposed professional system are not fulfilled in the context of the application of the principle of equal treatment between workers and self-employed persons who have suffered a reduction or total loss of professional income between 14 March and 3 May 2020 and, on the other hand, workers and self-employed persons who, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic after that date, receive 15 days of temporary unemployment or the transitional right for self-employed persons; 4. By providing that the transfer to which payment of the premium is made shall be made to "a Belgian account', the proposed scheme restricts the freedom of movement of services guaranteed by Union law. Moreover, the holders of a Belgian bank account and those who have not been subject to a Belgian bank account shall be treated differently.
