It therefore concerns (i) the persons in contact with the public in training which, on the date of 18 March 2020, has been appointed for less than one year in that capacity, and (ii) the persons in contact with the public who are appointed between 18 March 2020 and 30 June 2020 in that capacity in that capacity. That additional period of four months will also be taken into account as a period of relevant practical experience in accordance with Article 17, § 1, fourth paragraph, of the Royal Decree of 18 June 2019.For those persons in contact with the public, the continued training obligation is laid down in Articles 12, § 4, and 15, § 8, of the Royal Decree of 29 October 2015 implementing Title 4 of Book VII of the Code of Conduct of the Bank of Belgium.The Council of State shall indicate any difference in treatment between, on the one hand, the persons for whom the refresher period has commenced before 18 March 2020 but which will expire before 31 December 2020 and, on the other hand, the persons for whom the refresher period has also started before 18 March 2020, but which will expire after 31 December 2020. According to the Council of State, the benefit of the extension of the period of time shall not apply to this last category of persons, however, in the period of the exclusionary measures under the COVID-19-pandemic will not apply to the criterion for determining the refresher periods to which the extension measure applies, and, on the other hand, the calculation of the period of refresher periods to which the period of refresher period is limited to the period of time during which the period of time during which the period of the period of time during which the period of the period of time of the period of time of the period of the period of time of the period of time of the period of the period of time of the period of time of the period of the period of time of the period of the period of the period of time of the period of the period of the period of time of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of time of the period of the period of time of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of time of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of time of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of study of the period of the period ofThe same reasoning also applies to the recognized compliance officers and staff of the compliance departments of regulated undertakings.The rules for calculating their refresher periods are similar to those applicable to intermediaries, as for intermediaries, calculated by calendar year, starting on 1 January of the year following their recognition or appointment.The refresher periods of the other compliance officers, i.e. those which have been recognised or entered into service from 1 June 2018, should not be calculated more per calendar year, but in function of the date of their recognition or entry into service.So the first refresher period of a compliance officer on 1 June 2018 would begin on 1 June 2018 on the date on which the other compliance officers, i.e. shall expire on the date on which they entered into service, should not be calculated on the basis of the date of their recognition or entry into service.Having regard to the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and in particular to the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy,In order to avoid taking decisions which would be detrimental to them, [it appears therefore appropriate] to grant a further period of time quickly to persons who, within a certain period of time, have to pass an examination in order to demonstrate that they have the necessary professional knowledge, such measures should be taken as soon as possible and in certain cases retroactively until the start of the isolation period, account should be taken of the fact that sanctions are linked to non-compliance with the training obligations and that this may also prevent the exercise of the function of the profession." 2.
