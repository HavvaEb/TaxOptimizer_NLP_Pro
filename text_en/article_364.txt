It is important that all citizens are given the opportunity to be vaccinated. This is certainly true of the operational staff of the relief zones, as referred to in Article 14 of the Law of 15 May 2007 on Civil Security. For the operationality of the service it is appropriate that vaccination can be carried out as smoothly as possible, without any difficulties or disadvantages for the operational staff. With this letter I want to give guidelines to the relief zones for their operational staff: the professional firefighters and the voluntary firefighters, the professional ambulances and the voluntary ambulancers. The operational staff member who is invited to be vaccinated at a time when he/she is required to perform for the relief zones under the employment scheme imposed on him/her, may leave the service for the appropriate time and receive a mission service. If appropriate, the mission authorisation shall be granted to every necessary injection.Honorable Brussels, 9 March 2021. A. VERLINDEN, Minister for the Interior, Institutional Reforms and Democratic Renewal _______ Note (1) See Article 3 of the Royal Decree of 19 April 2014 on the remuneration of operational personnel of the relief zones
