Royal Decree No 13 amending Law No 23 of 23 March 2020 amending the Law of 22 December 2016 introducing a transitional right for selfemployed persons and introducing temporary measures for selfemployed persons, in particular with regard to the extension to certain selfemployed persons in the occupation and active pensioners REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, The draft decision which we have the honour to submit for signature by Your Majesty aims to strengthen the temporary crisis measures taken by the social status of selfemployed persons in the context of COVID-19. At present, the temporary crisis measure provides for the granting of a partial financial allowance for the temporary crisis measure over bridging entitlement for certain selfemployed persons who are required to interrupt their activities by COVID-19.In the same example, in the case of temporary unemployment benefit, the benefit in the context of the temporary crisis relief measure will be reduced to EUR 1,100: it will be reduced to EUR 1,100: it will then still be possible for the person concerned to benefit from an allowance of up to EUR 1,100 or for the person concerned to benefit from an allowance of up to EUR 1,100 or for the person concerned to benefit from an allowance of up to EUR 1,100 or for the person concerned to benefit from an allowance of up to EUR 1,100 in the case of a pension of up to EUR 5,10 in the case of a pension of up to EUR 5,10 in the case of a temporary unemployment benefit, in the case of a temporary unemployment benefit of up to EUR 1,100 in the case of an allowance of up to EUR 1,100 in the case of an allowance of up to EUR 5,10 in the case of a pension or not).The purpose of this temporary crisis measure is also to cover the following situations, where it is strictly applicable within the framework of the temporary crisis measure on the basis of the principle of equal treatment of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of women in the case of men and women in the case of men and women in the case of men and in the case of men and in the case of men and in the case of men and women.In the event of an overrun, the monthly amount of the temporary crisis measure will be reduced to the amount of this excess. The measure does not, in any event, allow the financial allowance of the temporary crisis measure to be granted over the bridge right for an independent activity already interrupted for reasons other than COOVID-19. Thus, a self-employed person in incapacity for work or invalidity is not entitled to the temporary crisis measure of bridging right. On the other hand, the self-employed person who enjoys the temporary crisis measure of bridging right for a month (e.g. for the month of April) and who is recognised as unfit for work in the same month, will not be entitled to the financial allowance of bridging right. He will not be entitled to the temporary disability benefits of his own activity on the first day of the following month (e.g. from 1 May). Finally, self-employed persons in incapacity or invalidity who are engaged in an independent activity authorised by the counsellore of their mutuality, shall not be entitled to the temporary crisis measure of bridging right.Article 3 of the Law of 23 March 2020 amending the Law of 22 December 2016 amending the Law of 22 December 2016 on the application of the Law of 23 March 2020 to self-employed personsArticle 3 deletes the references to the provisions of the Law of 22 December 2016 which prevent cumulation with another replacement income. In addition, the condition of being registered in the Belgian National Register. Next, the automatic retention of social rights provided for in Article 3 2°, of the Law of 22 December 2016, is deleted. Article 4 provides that the invalidity benefits are to be granted for the period covered by the monthly financial compensation of the temporary crisis bridge law. Article 5 provides that the draft decision shall have effect from 1 March 2020. Article 6 provides that the Minister for Social Affairs and the Minister for Selfemployed Persons, each of whom shall be charged with the execution of this decision, shall be refused for the period covered by the monthly financial compensation of the temporary crisis bridge law.The report of Cedric Jenart, Deputy Auditor of State, Michel Tison and Johan Put, Assessors, and Wim Geurts, Registrar of the Court of First Instance.
