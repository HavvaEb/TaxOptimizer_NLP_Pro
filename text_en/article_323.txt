The Royal Decree amending the Royal Decree of 15 September 2020 granting, pursuant to the COOVID-19 pandemic, an additional crisis benefit to certain disabled self-employed persons and assisting spouses REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, The Royal Decree which we have the honour to submit for signature, aims to extend, until 30 June 2021, the granting of an additional crisis benefit to certain disabled self-employed persons and assisting spouses as a result of the COOVID-19 pandemic. In the light of the Council of State's Opinion No 69.121/1 of 2 April 2021 and in the light of the comments made, the additional crisis benefit referred to in the Royal Decree of 15 September 2020 granting, pursuant to the COVID-19 pandemic, an additional crisis benefit to certain disabled self-employed persons and assisting spouses is no longer granted for the period of incapacity beyond 31 March 2021.This measure, which is expressly linked to the COOVID-19 pandemic, is therefore compatible, within the benefit insurance scheme, with the principle of constitutional equality in view of the scale, severity and exceptional nature of this COOVID-19 pandemic which allows many self-employed and assisting spouses to no longer pursue their professional activity and to claim only benefits from this benefit insurance.

a difference in treatment is compatible only with the constitutional principles of equality and non-discrimination where that difference is based on an objective criterion and is reasonably justified; the existence of such a justification must be assessed, taking into account the objective and effects of the measure in question and the nature of the principles in question; the principle of equality is infringed where there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the objective pursued.(3) Conversely, according to the settled caselaw of the Constitutional Court, the constitutional rules of equality and non-discrimination are contrary to the principle of categories of persons in respect of a measure in essentially different situations, which are treated in an identical manner, without being justified by reason, the principle of principle, the principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principle of principleIt follows from the foregoing that various parts of the proposed scheme may be of a nature to raise questions as to its compatibility with the principle of equality guaranteed by the Constitutional Law. In order to avoid any ambiguity or speculation in that regard, the authors of the draft plan should be able to provide the proposed scheme with an adequate justification in the light of the principle of equality and to include that justification in a report to the King when the royal decree is to be adopted.' The same remark applies to the proposed amendment of the Royal Decree of 15 September 2020.(5) In view of the date on which this opinion is to be delivered, Article 2 of the draft decision provides that the proposed scheme is to be granted retroactive force in accordance with the terms of Article 22 of the said Article: "This decision has been adopted with effect from 1 April 2021'.- the Royal Decree amending the Royal Decree of 15 September 2020 granting, pursuant to the COOVID-19 pandemic, an additional crisis benefit to certain disabled self-employed persons and assisting spouses FILIP, King of Belgium, to all who are now and will be listed below, Our Greet.
