The Royal Decree amending the Royal Decree of 22 August 2020 temporarily derogating from certain time limits in the procedure for verifying expenditure contained in Article 164 of the Royal Decree of 25 November 1991 on unemployment regulation for the sake of the COVID-19 virus FILIP, King of Belgium, to all who are now and will be listed below, Our Regret. Having regard to the Decree Law of 28 December 1944 on social security for workers, Article 7, Paragraph 1, paragraph 3 (i), replaced by the Law of 14 February 1961, and Paragraph 2, last amended by the Law of 8 April 2003; Having regard to the Royal Decree of 25 November 1991 on unemployment regulation; Having regard to the Law of 25 April 1963 on the management of institutions of public benefit for social security and social security, Article 15; having regard to the opinion of the Inspector of 31 March 2021, and to the Decision of 25 November 1991 on the Royal Decree of 25 November 1991 on the unemployment regulation for the purposes of the COVID-19 virus; having regard to the Law of 25 April 1963 on the temporary derogation from certain time limits in the procedure for the verification of expenditure laid down in Article 164 of the Royal Decree of 25 November 1991 on the Law of 25 November 1991 on the Law of 25 April 1963 on the Law of 25 April 1963 on the Law of 25 April 1963 on social security for social security and social security, Article 15;The applications of the pay-out institutions in time and in some cases only for a long time after the payment has been made to the National Employment Office in Brussels, which in those cases did not allow the benefit card confirming the entitlement to benefits to be drawn up at a later date than would normally have been the case; that without the existence of a benefit card it is not possible to verify the expenditure incurred by the paying institutions; that, for those reasons, it remains problematic for the National Employment Office also to verify expenditure incurred by the paying institutions in July, August, September, October and November 2020 within the normal time limits laid down, so that an extension of these time-limits, coupled with an extension of the time-limits for possible re-submission by the paying institutions of the rejected expenditure, is necessary; that the failure to extend these time-limits would not result in effect that expenditure could not be verified within the existing period, should be considered as being broadly and definitively approved by the pay-out institutions, even if they were wrong; that the taking of this measure is high, since the current verification procedures provided for the payment of the expenditure by the agencies in August and the time-out institutions in question would be subject to the
