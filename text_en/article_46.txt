The Royal Decree amending the Royal Decree No 20 of 20 July 1970 fixing the rates of value added tax and classifying the goods and services in those tariffs to the restaurant and catering services REPORT TO THE KONING Sire, since September 2020 Belgium has faced a deterioration in the epidemiological situation and has experienced a second wave of the COOVID-19 epidemic. In view of the state of affairs, the Government decided on 16 October 2020, inter alia, to re-close the entire hospitality (bars, cafés, restaurants, etc.) from 19 October 2020 to, initially, at the end of 2020, to delay the spread of the virus as much as possible. Since that epidemiological situation has deteriorated further after 31 December 2020, the successive Conciliation Committees that have taken place have not reasonably decided to relax the measure taken on 16 October 2020 so that the said establishments have not received customers since 19 October 2020.It follows from the foregoing that, in the light of the foregoing considerations, the Commission considers that, in the light of the above considerations, it is necessary to examine whether the measure in question is compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty and in the light of the considerations set out in Article 107 (3) (c) of the Treaty and Article 108 (3) of the Treaty, and in the light of the considerations set out in Article 107 (1) of the Treaty, to determine whether the measure in question is compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty, and in particular Article 107 (1) of the Treaty and Article 108 (3) of the Treaty.In Table A of the Annex to Royal Decree No 20, the following shall be required to make the distinction in this respect: the personal scope remains unchanged in comparison with the previous measure. The nature or name of the establishment which the restaurant or catering services provide is therefore not relevant for the application of this temporary measure. It may therefore include the following providers and establishments: - fast food and self-service restaurants; - restaurants in theatres (clubs...), museums and shopping centres; - canteens and business messes; - hotels or guest rooms with half- or full-board; - cafeterias, bars, cafés, teasalons and discotheques; - food trucks, snack cars; - caterers, bakeries with consumption salons; - temporary stands for sale or consumption on a festival, on a market.Having regard to the laws of the Council of State, coordinated on 12 January 1973, Article 3 (1); having regard to the urgency of the matter; whereas, for more than one year, our country has undergone a serious sanitary crisis following the global pandemic of the COVID-19 virus and that that pandemic has forced the Government to take drastic measures to restrict individual and collective freedoms; whereas, taking into account the present situation, the Government, after the meeting of the Consultative Committee of 16 October 2020, decided in particular to resume the whole hospitality (bars, cafés, restaurants,...) at least until the end of 2020 in order to delay the spread of the virus as much as possible; whereas, at the end of 2020, that decision has not been improved in any way and even aggravated during that period;Brussels, 27 April 2021.
