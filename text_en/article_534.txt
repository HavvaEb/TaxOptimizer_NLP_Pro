The Decree approving the special powers decisions taken in implementation of the Decree of 23 March 2020 granting special powers to the College of the French Community Commission in the framework of the COOVID-19 pandemic MEMORIE OF APPLICANCE This draft Decree aims to ratify the texts adopted by the College of the French Community Commission in the framework of the special powers entrusted to it by the Decree of 23 March 2020 to grant special powers to the College of the French Community Commission in the context of the health crisis COOVID-19, pursuant to Article 4 thereof, which provides that the decisions referred to in Articles 2 and 3 of the Decree conferring special powers must be ratified within a period of six months from the end of the period of the special powers, with the exception of 24 June 2020.It would be difficult for the College's ex post practice to be made more complex while the effects of the health crisis persist. However, if this provision were not included in this draft decree, the College would normally have the power to take certain measures, but it would be necessary to formally adopt a decree to amend subsequently the ratified provisions. Therefore, the present draft decree is also intended to ratify "classical" decisions of the College for which - under the possibility provided for in Article 4 (2) - certain prior formalities may not have been completed. NOTE TO ARTICLES Article 1 No comment. Article 2 These articles confirm the various special powers decisions of the College which have been adopted pursuant to the Decree of 23 March 2020. Article 3 After ratification by the legislator, all provisions adopted by a special power decision shall be adopted or amended by law. They may therefore no longer be amended by a formal decree.The Commission of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Union of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Union of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the European Communities of the single day, of the single day, of the single day, of the single day, of at the European Union of at the European Union of at the single day, of the European Union of the single day, of the single day, of the single day, of the single day, of the single day, of the single day, of the day, of the day, of the day, of the day, of the day, of the day, of the day, of the day, of the day, of the day, of the day, day, day, day, day, day, of the day, of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day ofThis Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
