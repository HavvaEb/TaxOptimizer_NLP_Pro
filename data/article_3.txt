Decree of the Government of the French Community of Special Powers No. 33 on the adjustment of the timetable of the external evaluations not ratified for the 2020-2021 school year in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis The Government of the French Community , Having regard to the Decree of 17 March 2020 conferring special powers on the Government in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis, Article 1, § 1, f); Having regard to the Decree of 2 June 2006 regarding the external evaluation of the acquired knowledge of pupils in compulsory education and the certificate of primary education after primary education; Having regard to the urgency motivated by the need to enable the French Community to react, before the end of the school year, to the measures taken in the context of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, in accordance with Article 1 , § 1, f, of the Decree of March 17, 2020 conferring special powers on the Government in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis, by adapting the timetable of the external evaluations that are not ratified, so that the schools to be able to safely organize the next school year and to concentrate on the health and pedagogical measures to be implemented; Having regard to the advice no. 67.567/2 of the Council of State, given on June 12, 2020, pursuant to Article 84, § 1, paragraph 1, 3°, of the laws on the Council of State, coordinated on January 12, 1973 ; Considering that, in accordance with Article 8, § 4, of the Decree of 2 June 2006 on the external evaluation of the acquired knowledge of pupils in compulsory education and the certificate of primary education after primary education (hereinafter referred to as the Decree on external evaluations) subject to the external evaluations that are not ratified (EENC) between 1 and 31 October of the same school year Whereas, in accordance with Article 8, § 1, second paragraph, of the Decree on external evaluations and the decision of the Government of the French Community of 10 May 2017 approving the three-year plan with regard to external evaluations not certified with a certificate in humanities general and technological and in vocational and technical humanities (2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021 ), as amended by the Decree of the Government of the French Community of 24 May 2019 (hereinafter the Decree of the Reg Regulation of the French Community of 10 May 2017), the EENC relate to the reading and production of written documents in the third and fifth year of primary education and only to reading in the fourth year of secondary education; Whereas the original timetable for the EENC provided for pre-tests of the evaluations in May 2020, which should have been followed by a period of analysis of the results and then finalization of the evaluation design; Considering the Ministerial Decree of 23 March 2020 concerning urgent measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19, as amended on 25 May 2020, and in particular the suspension of classes and activities in pre-primary, primary and secondary education; Considering that after the suspension of classes in the schools, the external evaluation which is not endorsed could not be tested in advance; Whereas pre-tests are a necessary step to ensure the scientific basis of the evaluation and its quality and therefore the results that would result would be of limited validity and their use in support of school governance would be questionable; Considering that after the long period of suspension of classes during this school year and the uncertainty about the next school year, the timetable for conducting the assessments in the schools, which is planned for October in accordance with the Decree on external assessments, is likely to be unfavorable and will be insufficient to mobilize all pupils involved in the EENC during three teaching periods; Whereas the same applies to the time needed to improve evaluations and, above all, to interpret and appropriate the results by the pedagogical teams, a task which is one of the essential elements of the system; Whereas the binding aspect of the assessments is probably unwelcome, as the learning time will be counted in the classrooms; Whereas the organization of the next school year is at present unknown and will most likely have a significant impact on the conduct of evaluations; Whereas the evaluations for the general and technological humanities and the vocational and technical humanities were originally planned for October 2019, but in order to allow the different actors to take advantage of the time needed to adapt to the change related to the planned reforms in the framework of the Pact of Excellence, they have been exceptionally postponed for one year on the basis of the decision of the Government of the French Community of 24 May 2019 amending the decision of the Government of the French Community of 10 May 2017; Whereas delaying the whole system by one year for the second consecutive year would be sending a message to the actors that the external evaluations that are not endorsed are not indispensable; Considering that both the European education policy and the new school administration provided for in the Excellence Pact require the regular organization of external evaluations that are endorsed; Considering that external evaluations that are not endorsed are an essential steering tool and that it is therefore important to maintain them in the 2020-2021 school year; Whereas, moreover, postponing these evaluations until the following school year would lead to a delay of five years between two evaluations on the same subject and it would be impossible to take advantage of the recent results; Whereas, for all these reasons, the external evaluations that will not be endorsed in the 2020-2021 school year should be maintained and a new timetable should be established; Considering that the numbered decree will take effect from the day of its publication in the Belgian Official Gazette, it is urgent to inform schools before the end of the school year, so that they can safely start the school year in September 2020 organizing and being able to focus on the health and certainly pedagogical measures to be implemented. In this regard, this Decree complies with the conditions imposed by the case law of the Council of State and the Constitutional Court regarding the retroactive effect of the regulatory provisions in the light of the exceptional circumstances which led to their adoption and the achieving an objective of general interest, such as the right to education, the right of every child to measures and services that contribute to his or her development, as well as the primary interest of the child; Considering that, in accordance with Article 3 of the Decree of 17 March 2020 conferring special powers on the Government in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis, the decisions referred to in Article 1 may be adopted without prior approval of the legal or regulatory requirements opinions, consultations and negotiations have been taken or organised, but are nevertheless adopted after having obtained the advice of the Legislative Division of the Council of State, unless the latter determines that it is unable to provide its advice within a period of five days to be communicated On the recommendation of the Minister of Education ; After deliberation, Decision: Article 1.
