Special power decision No 2020/030 of the Brussels Capital Government concerning aid to undertakings undergoing a decline in their activity as a result of the health crisis COVID-19 Report to the Government In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brussels Capital Government decided to support the Brussels economy and employment through a series of emergency measures.The aim was to support the most affected sectors.In the light of the changing economic situation, the demand for additional support for heavily affected economic operators arose.The Brussels Government has agreed to grant a compensation premium of EUR 2,000 to support entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises (between 0 and 5 FTE) who are faced with a significant decline in their activity due to the measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19.The budget for this measure is EUR 102 million.This premium may be granted more specifically to applicants with an establishment and personal resources and own assets in the territory of the Brussels Capital Region (recording unit of undertakings).In order to facilitate the processing of the expected large number of applications, it is intended to cooperate with the Social Insurance Association of Selfemployed Persons (RSV) and the Cross Point Bank of Social Security of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund of the Social Security Fund.Article 36 (4) of the GDPR must be read in conjunction with its first paragraph, which provides the following: "If a data protection impact assessment pursuant to Article 35 reveals that the processing would present a high risk if the controller did not take measures to reduce the risk, the controller shall consult the supervisory authority prior to processing.' This high risk is not present in this case, all the more so since the data collected by the administration are personal identification data which would not be sensitive data within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR. The Data Protection Authority (GBA) confirms that only if it appears that the planned processing would pose a high risk if the controller did not take effective risk-limiting measures, the processing should be submitted to the supervisory authority prior to processing. If the risk can be sufficiently limited by appropriate technical and organisational measures, no prior consultation should take place.'The Council of State considers that Article 8 has been rewritten by adding the list of categories of personal data that BEW may collect and process in the context of the implementation of the scheme. As recommended by the Council of State, Article 8 (1) paragraph is omitted. Article 9 of the draft defines certain situations in which the premium cannot be granted and must be reimbursed if it is granted. The Council of State considers that the wording of the situations in paragraphs 7° and 8° is not sufficiently clear, in particular as regards the relationship between these two situations.In addition, as the Council of State has rightly pointed out, the technical nature of the legislation at issue makes it difficult to establish the legality of the infringement. Finally, it is important to note that the minutes relating to the infringements referred to in Article 14, since in this type of disputes often use the applicant's word against that of the administration.Having regard to the decree of 19 March 2020 granting special powers to the Brussels Capital Government in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis, Article 2 (1) and (3) thereof,: the undertaking, natural or legal person, receiving the aid; 5° full transitional right: the monthly amount of the financial compensation referred to in Article 10 (1) of the Law of 22 December 2016 introducing a transitional right for self-employed persons and Article 4 (1) of the Law of 23 March 2020 amending the Law of 22 December 2016 introducing a transitional right for self-employed persons and introducing temporary measures in the context of COVID-19 in favour of self-employed persons; 6° temporarily unemployed in the context of COVID-19: temporary unemployment for force majeure in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, pursuant to the procedure laid down in Article 12 of the Royal Decree of 30 March 2020 adapting the procedures in the context of temporary unemployment for reasons of the COVID-19 virus and amending Article 10 of the Royal Decree of 6 May 2019 amending Articles 27, 51, 52a, 58, 3 and 63 of the Royal Decree of 25 November 1991 on unemployment rules and incorporating Articles 36a and 124a of the same Regulation of 18 December 2013 on the basis;within the scope of Article 4 (2) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, in accordance with the opinion of the European Parliament and of the Council (hereinafter referred to as "the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy') in accordance with the opinion of the European Parliament and of the Council (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy') in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy') in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee') and with the opinion of the Economic and Financial Affairs Committee (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee').Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p.4° at the time of the submission of the aid application, initiated before March 2020, is in a state of bankruptcy or liquidation, has ceased its business, has made a declaration of bankruptcy, is pending before it or is in a similar situation following a similar procedure consisting of other national regulations; 5° has deliberately supplied incorrect information; 6° is in one of the cases referred to in Article 3 (1), first paragraph, of the order of 8 October 2015 laying down general rules on retention, recovery and non-clearance of subsidies in respect of employment and economics, as long as it does not refund the subsidies referred to in the said order in Article 4; 7° is obliged, in the context of the COVID crisis, to repay the payments made under the transitional right to tender, in the situations referred to in Article 4, point 1 and 2°; 8° has committed an infringement in the context of the temporary unemployment referred to in Article 4, point 3° and 4° on the basis of the conditions laid down in Article 4 of the first paragraph of Article 4 of that provision.For the purpose of ensuring effective compliance with the provisions of this Decision, the following shall apply:
