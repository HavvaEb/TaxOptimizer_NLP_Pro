In addition, he must be able to offer staff placed in economic unemployment two training days per month. The requirement of the existence of a collective agreement or business plan providing for the payment of a supplement is maintained in this context. The maximum number of weeks in which the served persons may be placed in economic unemployment is increased until the end of 2020. The maximum of sixteen calendar weeks per calendar year (in the case of a full suspension) or six calendar weeks per calendar year (in the case of a partial employment scheme) is increased by eight weeks (in the case of a supplement) is increased by eight weeks.This chapter regulates a special formula for reducing the working performance to which a benefit is linked. It concerns a measure which existed in the years 2009-2011 in order to accommodate the crisis and to allow employers to reduce their work performance in accordance with the law of 22 January 1985 in order to reduce their working hours to a period of less than one year. This chapter provides a special formula for reducing the work performance to which a benefit is linked.This Article lays down a number of temporary adjustments, until the end of 2020, to the existing system of suspension of the employment agreement for employed persons who are no longer in a position to rely on temporary unemployment for reasons of force majeure resulting from the COVID-19 epidemic Article 12 This Article lays down the scope of the transitional arrangements. The measure shall apply to employers who are no longer in a position to rely on temporary unemployment for reasons of force majeure in respect of their employees in respect of the suspension of the employment agreement for reasons of temporary force majeure for reasons of the coronavirus COVID-19. Article 13 This Article lays down a number of temporary adjustments, until the end of 2020, to the existing system of suspension of the employment agreement for workers who are no longer in a position to benefit from the conditions laid down in Article 51 of the law in respect of employment in respect of their employees.In addition, it must be stated that, in accordance with Article 7 (4), point 7 of the Law of 3 July 1978, the amount of the supplement to be paid to the servant in temporary economic unemployment. In the event of use of a business plan, it must be demonstrated that the undertaking in the preceding quarter has a substantial reduction of at least 10% of its turnover or production in comparison with the same quarter of 2019. In addition, the employer in the business plan must commit itself to providing the undertaking in full suspension of the performance of the agreement or the scheme of partial employment, two training days per month.On 18 June 2020, the Council of State, for its part, asked the Minister of Work, within a period of five working days, to give an opinion on a draft of the Law of 27 March 2020 authorising the King to take measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 (II) to support the employers' and employees' group on the basis of Article 7 (1), § 6 of the Law of 3 July 1978, Chapter 6 - Final provisions Article 15 Article 15 sets out the date of entry into force and non-entry into force of the various chapters of this Decision. Article 16 designates the ministers responsible for the implementation of the Act. I have the honour to be, Sire, Van Your Majesty, the very respectful and very faithful servant, La Ministre des Affaires sociales, M. DE BLOCK The Minister of Work, N. MUYLLE COUNCIL OF STATE Department of Legislation, of 25 June 2020 on a draft of Royal Decree No......, pursuant to Article 5, § 1, 5° of the Law of 27 March 2020 authorizing the King to take measures in the fight against the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-19 (II) to support the employers's and employees'However, 12 January 1973, the Law Department of 27 May 1973 had to limit itself to examining the jurisdiction of the author of the act, the legal basis, and the question whether the formal requirements to be fulfilled were met.(Chapter 1), corona-time credit (Chapter 2) and landing runways (Chapter 3) is reserved to undertakings whose recognition as a firm in restructuring or as a firm in difficulty(3) starts before 1 January 2021. To explain the choice by 1 January 2021 as a final date, the agent replied as follows: "However, as the forecasts of the planning agency indicate, the economy is expected to recover from 2021. It is of course difficult to estimate the correct duration of the recovery." 4.2. For the purpose of defining the scope of the measures provided for in Chapters 1 to 3, it is not excluded that employees of undertakings whose period of recognition started before the start of the corona crisis, but whose period of recognition after 1 July 2020 is still open to take advantage of the measures.In the case of a file for the recognition of an undertaking in difficulty (without collective dismissal) or in restructuring on the basis of a percentage of economic unemployment (20 %), the maximum recognition shall not be 1 year from the date of the start of the recognition of an undertaking in difficulty (without collective redundancies) or in the case of restructuring on the basis of a percentage of economic unemployment (20 %). In the case of undertakings without collective dismissal which wish to maximize the measures must take account of the duration of a file. The measures envisaged shall not enter into force on the date of the application and may not be applied at the earliest after receipt of the ministerial approval.The principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination does not require that the difference between cases falling within the scope of application is based on an objective criterion and that the existence of such a justification must be taken into account only by reason of the objective and the nature of the measure in question.In particular, with regard to the scope of the Corona Time Credit, the delegate suggests that: "The measure may run to a maximum from the announcement of a collective dismissal to a maximum of two years after the date of service of collective redundancies. Not in each recognition a duration of two years is provided for. As provided for in Article 5, second paragraph, the entire period of the Corona Time Credit should be fully covered by this recognition period. It may be considered that the decision may be adapted so that only undertakings with a recognition starting from 1 March 2020 or later may be eligible for the measures'. In any case, the suggestion to further restrict the scope of the measure to undertakings recognised from 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020 may be considered by the Steller of the text for Chapters 1 to 3 of the above in order to meet the above by reference 4.3.In addition, for reasons of clarity and legal certainty, in a new Article 353a/7/1 of the Programme Law (I) of 24 December 2002, it is appropriate to refer to Article 4, second and third paragraphs of the draft Article 4 of the Programme Law (I) of 24 December 2002 to Article 4, second and third paragraphs of that Article, in a new Article 4 of the draft Article 4 of the Programme Act (I) of the Programme Act (I) of 24 December 2002 to Article 4, second and third paragraphs, the question arises as to whether it is no longer appropriate for the provisions of Article 4, second and third paragraphs of the draft Article, to be included in Chapter 4 of the draft Article 4 of the Programme Act (I) of the Programme Act (I) of 24 December 2002 to refer to Article 4 of the Act (I) of the Act of 24 December 2002 to Article 4 of the Act of 24 December 2002 to be applied to Article 3 of that Article 3 of the Law.Article 4 (1) of the draft directive provides that the corona-time credit may be extended to employers who are subject to the law of 5 December 1968 on collective agreements and joint agreements.On 1 January 2014, the Commission decided to initiate proceedings under Article 18 of the Royal Decree of 3 May 2007 on the basis of Article 18 of the Royal Decree of 3 May 2007 on the application of Article 4 (2) and (3) of the Single Payment Scheme.
