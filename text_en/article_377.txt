Royal decision making the special measures for the protection of public collective investment undertakings with a variable number of units against the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic REPORT TO THE KONING, Sire, The COVID-19 epidemic causes a health crisis which also has a severe impact on the economy and financial markets. For a few weeks now, we have been witnessing, among other things, a sharp fall in the price of financial markets and a high volatility. For collective investment undertakings, this has an impact on various aspects. Such market conditions can cause liquidity problems in the markets and serious problems for collective investment undertakings facing requests for purchase of rights of participation by their investors (see comment on the articles for a more detailed explanation on this matter). It is also necessary to take into account an increased risk of unavailability of personnel due to disease. The health measures imposed by the government to offset the spread of the COVID-19 virus also make it difficult for the collective investment institutions to organise their general meeting and their accounts.Article 2 - Measures to safeguard the liquidity of collective investment undertakings In the circumstances set out above, there is a risk that investors will enter into the collective investment undertaking on a massive basis with a variable number of units, because the functioning of these collective investment undertakings is characterised by the fact that investors can liquidate their investment by asking the collective investment undertaking to purchase their units. Such withdrawals may put those collective investment undertakings and their participants at risk and, in an extreme scenario, have an impact on the markets themselves: -A collective investment undertaking facing redemption applications will be forced to liquidate positions in its portfolio in order to obtain the necessary liquidity; -In present market conditions, it is likely to become difficult to sell large positions in such circumstances or threaten to be at least little interesting and possibly lower than the market price indicated; - It is also feared that in a stress situation the most liquid assets of the portfolio are first realised, while other positions which do not have the same profile, should be maintained in the event of a realistic ability to sell them;In view of the circumstances described above, it is proposed that a temporary relaxation of the conditions for the use of the market conditions imposed by the rules governing the use of the pricing policy, in accordance with the rules set out below, should be introduced as soon as possible in view of the present market conditions:In the light of the usual rules for the publication of press releases, these notices must also be forwarded to the FSMA in advance of their publication. This notice must be published on the website of the collective investment company or of the management company and in accordance with the usual rules for the publication of press releases, or via any other equivalent means of communication approved by the FSMA. The information on the mechanism to be included under the normal rules in the prospectus shall be included in this notice.The Minister of Finance, A. DE CROO The Minister of Economy, N. MUYLLE ________ Note (1) Royal Decree of 15 October 2018 amending the Royal Decree of 7 March 2006 relating to securities lending by certain collective investment undertakings, the Royal Decree of 10 November 2006 on the accounts, the annual accounts and periodic reports of certain public collective investment undertakings with a variable number of units, the Royal Decree of 12 November 2012 on the management companies of collective investment undertakings which fulfil the conditions of Directive 2009/65/EC, the Royal Decree of 12 November 2012 on the collective investment undertakings which fulfil the conditions of Directive 2009/65/EC and the Royal Decree of 25 February 2017 on certain public alternative collective investment undertakings and their management companies, and laying down various provisions.On 12 January 1973, the Commission's request for an opinion in particular must state the reasons for its urgency in the form of the following statement of reasons: "The urgency is justified by the Covid-19 epidemic, which causes considerable tensions on the financial markets, including a sharp fall in prices and high volatility, which may cause liquidity problems in the markets and serious problems for collective investment undertakings faced with requests for the purchase of units by their investors. However, in current market conditions it is likely to be difficult to sell large positions or to threaten to be of little interest and possibly even lower than the market price indicated. As a result, investors who in such circumstances retain their participation in the collective investment undertaking may be disadvantaged. However, the Royal Decree of 15 October 2018 introduced a number of mechanisms which may be used by the institutions for collective investment to maintain their liquidity and to avoid the above-mentioned difficulties.As regards those three points, the draft gives rise to the following comments. Examination of the draft Rule 1. Article 108 of the Constitution should not be included as the legal basis of the draft, since the provisions of the law referred to in the second and third paragraphs of the introductory paragraphs provide a sufficient legal basis for the draft. The first paragraph of the preamble must be omitted. 2. The Minister's delegate agrees that the second paragraph should be supplemented by the reference to Article 88 (3), fourth paragraph of the Law of 3 August 2012 on collective investment undertakings which comply with the conditions of Directive 2009/65/EC and the undertakings for investment in debt claims' and that the third paragraph of the preamble should therefore be supplemented by the reference to Article 252 (3), third paragraph of the Law of 19 April 2014 on alternative undertakings for collective investment and their managers.In the first paragraph of paragraph 3 of the same paragraph, the words "du" should be replaced by the words "de la possibilité visée au" in the English version of the same text. In the French text of paragraph 3 the words "grand tirage" should be replaced by the words "de la possibilité visée au" in the French version of the same text, the words "possibility" in the French text of paragraph 3 should be replaced by the words "grand tirage" in the French version of the same text shall be inserted between the words "possibility" in the French text of paragraph 3.the prospectus must be made public, the Minister's delegate replied to the following: "Cette précision ne nous paraît pas nécessaire. Pour les OPCA, l'application du point IV, 5, troisième tiret, de l'annexe A de l'AR du 25 février 2017 (= disposition sur la base de laquelle ce pourement doit normalement être inclus dans les statuts) est déjà exclue par le § 2, 2°.

However, the application of these mechanisms requires the statutes, management rules and prospectus of the institutions concerned to enable them to use them, which is often not the case. In these circumstances a temporary relaxation of these mechanisms is proposed, so that they can be effectively applied as soon as possible. Moreover, it is important that measures be taken as quickly as possible by the collective investment undertakings under Belgian law to make use of these mechanisms in the light of the current market conditions. These measures are urgent, given the speed of developments in the financial markets. In addition, it is important that measures be taken as quickly as possible to ensure that undertakings for collective investment undertakings in the management of their management plans and thus to publish their periodic reports. Finally, the calculation of the net asset value of collective investment institutions for collective investment undertakings in the event of a large number of staff due to illness.The following provisions shall apply to undertakings for collective investment which comply with the conditions laid down in Directive 2009/65/EC:the conditions laid down in Directive 2009/65/EC; at the latest the first time the mechanism referred to in Article 21/1 of the Royal Decree of 10 November 2006 has been applied to the accounts, annual accounts and periodic reports of certain public undertakings for collective investment with a variable number of units, or to the mechanism referred to in Article 117 (4) of the Royal Decree of 12 November 2012 relating to collective investment undertakings meeting the conditions laid down in Directive 2009/65/EC, shall be published on the website of the collective investment undertaking or to that of the management company, as well as in two daily newspapers distributed nationally or in large quantities, or through any other equivalent means of communication approved by the FSMA.
